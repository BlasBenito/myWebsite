## About Me

I am a Spatial Data Scientist and Engineer by trade, and a PhD in Computational Ecology and MSc in Geographic Information Systems by education. 

I currently serve as the team lead of the Environmental Data Team at [Biome Makers Inc](www.biomemakers.com). In this role, I am responsible for designing and developing an Environmental Data Infrastructure to enhance our flagship product, BeCropÂ®, and conduct research and development in remote sensing and machine learning applications to smart farming tech.

## My Tech Stack

My tech stack is built entirely on open-source tools: I rely on [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [git](https://git-scm.com/)+[GitHub](https://github.com/) for collaborative software development and version control. For pipeline design, I harness the power of [targets](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/), and to encapsulate code I employ [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/) and [docker](https://www.docker.com/).

For GIS tasks, I turn to industry-standard tools like [GRASS GIS](https://grass.osgeo.org/), [Quantum GIS](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/), and [PostGIS](https://postgis.net/).

My data management and processing are handled by [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/), [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/), and [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/).

Computationally-intensive pipelines find their home in my tiny home-cluster managed by [slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html).

For developing and deploying REST APIs, I turn to [plumber](https://www.rplumber.io/), while interactive apps are crafted with [Shiny](https://shiny.posit.co/). My interactive reports come to life using either [Rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) or [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/r.html).

## My Academic Journey

Before delving into AgTech, I honed my research and technical skills during a successful academic career in Computational Ecology. I worked in world-class labs in Spain ([IISTA](http://www.iista.es/en/) and [Maestre Lab](https://maestrelab.com/en/)), Denmark ([Jens-Christian Svenning Lab](https://pure.au.dk/portal/en/svenning@biology.au.dk)), and Norway ([EECRG](https://www.uib.no/en/rg/EECRG)). My research  primarily focused on [unveiling the environmental drivers shaping the distribution of biological diversity in space and time](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=WBTp0McAAAAJ&hl=en). During this journey, I developed scientific R packages for various purposes, such as [time-series comparison](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=distantia) and [analysis of lagged effects](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=memoria), [spatial modeling with Random Forest](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=spatialRF), and [ecological simulation](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=virtualPollen).

## Beyond Work

In my leisure time, I cherish moments with my family, tinker on the piano with enthusiasm (regardless of the results!), embrace the serenity of the sea on my stand-up paddle board, and continue my passion for developing R packages.
