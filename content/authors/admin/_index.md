I believe there are three significant moments in the past that led me to become the scientist I am today: learning to write simple BASIC programs with my cousin’s [ZX Spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum) when I was five; observing the link between topography and vegetation in the karstic mountains of Andalusia when I was a Boy-Scout; and learning how ecological modeling improves our understanding on complex biological systems while attending a theoretical ecology course taught by [Prof. José María Gómez](http://www.modelingnature.org/jose-maria-gomez-1). These enriching experiences motivated me to pursue a Master in Geographical Information Systems and a PhD in Global Change Ecology, and to develop an international research career working at world-class research groups, such as Ecoinfo, lead by [Jens-Christian Svenning](https://pure.au.dk/portal/en/svenning@biology.au.dk) (Aarhus University, Denmark), and the Ecological and Environmental Change Research Group (University of Bergen, Norway).

Reaching a deeper understanding on the role of environmental drivers in shaping patterns and processes of species ecology and distributions over time and space is a pivotal topic in my research. I have focused particularly on the application of state-of-the-art quantitative methods, large-data approaches, and mechanistic modeling to answer ecological questions in a wide range of ecological systems and spatio-temporal scales.
