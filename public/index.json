[{"authors":["admin"],"categories":null,"content":"Hello there!\nMy name is Blas, and I am a spatial data scientist and engineer in AgTech, holding a PhD in computational ecology and an MSc in geographic information systems.\nMy expertise lies at the intersection of spatial and temporal modeling, soil and plant ecology, remote sensing, machine learning, and environmental dynamics and monitoring.\nMy work I\u0026rsquo;m deeply passionate about crafting automated data and modeling pipelines to tackle complex environmental challenges.\nCurrently, I lead the Environmental Data Team at Biome Makers Inc. In this role, I research and develop cutting-edge smart farming technologies, create essential R packages to enhance our Data Science Department\u0026rsquo;s capabilities, and oversee the design and maintenance of an environmental data infrastructure to further empower our flagship product, BeCropÂ®.\nMy Tech Stack My tech stack is built entirely on open-source tools: I rely on R and git+ GitHub for collaborative software development and version control. For pipeline design, I harness the power of targets, and to encapsulate code I employ renv and docker.\nFor GIS tasks, I turn to industry-standard tools like GRASS GIS, Quantum GIS, and PostGIS.\nMy data management and processing are handled by PostgreSQL, DuckDB, Apache Arrow, and Apache Spark.\nComputationally-intensive pipelines find their home in my tiny home-cluster managed by slurm.\nFor developing and deploying REST APIs, I turn to plumber, while interactive apps are crafted with Shiny. My interactive reports come to life using either Rmarkdown or Quarto.\nMy Academic Journey Before delving into AgTech, I honed my research and technical skills during a successful academic career in Computational Ecology. I worked in world-class labs in Spain ( IISTA and Maestre Lab), Denmark ( Jens-Christian Svenning Lab), and Norway ( EECRG).\nMy research primarily focused on unveiling the environmental drivers shaping the distribution of biological diversity in space and time. During this journey, I developed scientific R packages for various purposes, such as time-series comparison and analysis of lagged effects, spatial modeling with Random Forest, and ecological simulation.\nThroughout this journey, I collaborated with 210 esteemed coauthors from 22 countries to publish 49 research papers in reputable peer-reviewed journals. To date, our collective work has garnered over 1600 citations. Notably, three of these papers have received recognition as \u0026lsquo;most downloaded papers\u0026rsquo; in prestigious journals, and two have been honored as \u0026rsquo;editor\u0026rsquo;s picks\u0026rsquo;.\nBeyond Work In my leisure time, I cherish moments with my family, tinker on the piano with enthusiasm (regardless of the results!), embrace the serenity of the sea on my stand-up paddle board, and continue my passion for developing R packages.\nConnect with Me I\u0026rsquo;m always eager to connect with fellow data enthusiasts, researchers, and professionals. Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn to explore potential collaborations and discussions within our shared field.\n","date":1709596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1709619263,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://blasbenito.com/author/blas-m.-benito/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/blas-m.-benito/","section":"authors","summary":"Hello there!\nMy name is Blas, and I am a spatial data scientist and engineer in AgTech, holding a PhD in computational ecology and an MSc in geographic information systems.","tags":null,"title":"Blas M.

You likely had a nice bunch of numerical variables to use as predictors, no issues there. But then, you discovered among your columns thingies like \u0026ldquo;sampling_location\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;region_name\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;favorite_color\u0026rdquo;, or any other type of predictor made of strings, lots of strings. And some of these made sense, and some of them didn\u0026rsquo;t, because who knows where they came from. And you had to branch your code to deal with numeric and categorical variables separately. Or maybe chose to ignore them, as I have done plenty of times.\nYeah, nobody likes them much at all, But sometimes, these stringy monsters are all you have to move on with your work. And you are not the only one. That\u0026rsquo;s why many efforts have been made to convert them to numeric and kill the problem at once, so now we all have two problems instead.\nLet me go ahead and illustrate the issue. There is a nice data frame in the collinear R package named vi, with one response variable named vi_mean, and several numeric and categorical predictors named in the vector vi_predictors.\ndata( vi, vi_predictors ) dplyr::glimpse(vi) ## Rows: 30,000 ## Columns: 68 ## $ longitude \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;

What the hell happened here? Linear models cannot deal with categorical predictors, so they create numeric dummy variables instead.

Then, for each original category except the first one (\u0026ldquo;Af\u0026rdquo;), a new column with value 1 in the cases where the given category was present and 0 otherwise is created. The category with no column (\u0026ldquo;Af\u0026rdquo;) is represented in these cases in the intercept where all other dummy columns are zero. This is, essentially, one-hot encoding with a little twist. You will find most people use the terms dummy variables and one-hot encoding interchangeably, and that\u0026rsquo;s ok. But in the end, the little twist of omitting the first category is what differentiates them. Most functions performing one-hot encoding, no matter their name, are creating as many columns as categories.

If we created dummy variables for all categorical predictors in vi, then we\u0026rsquo;d go from the original 61 predictors to a total of 967 new columns to handle. This alone can degrade the computational performance of a model due to increased data size.\nThe second issue is increased multicollinearity. One-hot encoded features are highly collinear, which makes obtaining accurate estimates for the coefficients of the encoded categories very hard. Look at the Variance Inflation Factors of the encoded Koppen zones, they have incredibly high values!\ncollinear::vif_df( df = df ) ## variable vif ## 1 koppen_zone_Dfd 1.031226e+12 ## 2 koppen_zone_Cfc 1.493932e+13 ## 3 koppen_zone_ET 3.395786e+13 ## 4 koppen_zone_Dsa 3.549784e+13 ## 5 koppen_zone_Dsc 3.652432e+13 ## 6 koppen_zone_Dsb 7.338609e+13 ## 7 koppen_zone_Csb 1.323997e+14 ## 8 koppen_zone_Dwb 1.405032e+14 ## 9 koppen_zone_Dwc 1.592088e+14 ## 10 koppen_zone_Dwa 1.894423e+14 ## 11 koppen_zone_Csa 1.984881e+14 ## 12 koppen_zone_Cwb 2.624933e+14 ## 13 koppen_zone_Dfa 2.838687e+14 ## 14 koppen_zone_Cfb 3.834325e+14 ## 15 koppen_zone_Dfc 3.863684e+14 ## 16 koppen_zone_Dfb 6.139201e+14 ## 17 koppen_zone_Cwa 6.309241e+14 ## 18 koppen_zone_Am 7.440723e+14 ## 19 koppen_zone_Cfa 7.966760e+14 ## 20 koppen_zone_BWk 9.866240e+14 ## 21 koppen_zone_Af 9.879589e+14 ## 22 koppen_zone_BSk 1.100300e+15 ## 23 koppen_zone_BSh 1.158438e+15 ## 24 koppen_zone_Aw 2.177627e+15 ## 25 koppen_zone_BWh 2.403991e+15 On top of those issues, one-hot encoding also causes sparsity in tree-based models. Let me show you an example. Below I train a recursive partition tree using vi_mean as response, and the one-hot encoded version of koppen_zone we have in df.\n#add response variable to df df$vi_mean \u0026lt;- vi$vi_mean #fit model using all one-hot encoded variables koppen_zone_one_hot \u0026lt;- rpart::rpart( formula = vi_mean ~ ., data = df ) Now I do the same using the categorical version of koppen_zone in vi.\nkoppen_zone_categorical \u0026lt;- rpart::rpart( formula = vi_mean ~ koppen_zone, data = vi ) Finally, I am plotting the skeletons of these trees side by side (we don\u0026rsquo;t care about numbers here).\n#plot tree skeleton par(mfrow = c(1, 2)) plot(koppen_zone_one_hot, main = \u0026quot;One-hot encoding\u0026quot;) plot(koppen_zone_categorical, main = \u0026quot;Categorical\u0026quot;) Notice the stark differences in tree structure between both options. On the left, the tree trained on the one-hot encoded data only shows growth on one side! This is the sparsity I was talking about before. On the right side, however, the tree based on the categorical variable shows a balanced and healthy structure. One-hot encoded data can easily mess up a single univariate regression tree, so imagine what it can do to your fancy random forest model with hundreds of these trees.\nIn the end, the magic of one-hot encoding is in its inherent ability to create two or three problems for each one it promised to solve. We all know someone like that. Not so hot, if you ask me.\nTarget Encoding, Mean Encoding, and Dummy Variables (All The Same) On a bright summer day of 2001, Daniele Micci-Barreca finally got sick of the one-hot encoding wonders and decided to publish his ideas on a suitable alternative others later named mean encoding or target encoding. He told the story himself 20 years later, in a nice blog post titled Extending Target Encoding.\nBut what is target encoding? Let\u0026rsquo;s start with a continuous response variable y (a.k.a the target) and a categorical predictor x.\nMean Encoding In it\u0026rsquo;s simplest form, target encoding replaces each category in x with the mean of y across the category cases. This results in a new numeric version of x named x_encoded in the example below.\nyx |\u0026gt; dplyr::group_by(x) |\u0026gt; dplyr::mutate( x_encoded = mean(y) ) ## # A tibble: 7 Ã 3 ## # Groups: x [3] ## y x x_encoded ## \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; ## 1 1 a 2 ## 2 2 a 2 ## 3 3 a 2 ## 4 4 b 5 ## 5 5 b 5 ## 6 6 b 5 ## 7 7 c 7 Simple is good, right? But sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s not. In our toy case, the category \u0026ldquo;c\u0026rdquo; has only one case that maps directly to an actual value of y.Imagine the worst case scenario of x having one different category per row, then x_encoded would be identical to y!\nMean Encoding With Additive Smoothing The issue can be solved by pushing the mean of y for each category in x towards the global mean of y by the weighted sample size of the category, as suggested by the expression\n$$x\\_encoded_i = \\frac{n_i \\times \\overline{y}_i + m \\times \\overline{y}}{n_i + m}$$\nwhere:\n\\(n_i\\) is the size of the category \\(i\\). \\(\\overline{y}_i\\) is the mean of the target over the category \\(i\\). \\(m\\) is the smoothing parameter. \\(\\overline{y}\\) is the global mean of the target. y_mean \u0026lt;- mean(yx$y) m \u0026lt;- 3 yx |\u0026gt; dplyr::group_by(x) |\u0026gt; dplyr::mutate( x_encoded = (dplyr::n() * mean(y) + m * y_mean) / (dplyr::n() + m) ) ## # A tibble: 7 Ã 3 ## # Groups: x [3] ## y x x_encoded ## \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; ## 1 1 a 3 ## 2 2 a 3 ## 3 3 a 3 ## 4 4 b 4.5 ## 5 5 b 4.5 ## 6 6 b 4.5 ## 7 7 c 4.75 So far so good! But still, the simplest implementations of target encoding generate repeated values for all cases within a category. This can still mess-up tree-based models a bit, because splits may happen again and again in the same values of the predictor. However, there are several strategies to limit this issue as well.\nLeave-one-out Target Encoding In this version of target encoding, the encoded value of one case within a category is the mean of all other cases within the same category. This results in a robust encoding that avoids direct reference to the target value of the sample being encoded, and does not generate repeated values.\nThe code below implements the idea in a way so simple that it cannot even deal with one-case categories.\nyx |\u0026gt; dplyr::group_by(x) |\u0026gt; dplyr::mutate( x_encoded = (sum(y) - y) / (dplyr::n() - 1) ) ## # A tibble: 7 Ã 3 ## # Groups: x [3] ## y x x_encoded ## \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; ## 1 1 a 2.5 ## 2 2 a 2 ## 3 3 a 1.5 ## 4 4 b 5.5 ## 5 5 b 5 ## 6 6 b 4.5 ## 7 7 c NaN Mean Encoding with White Noise Another way to avoid repeated values while keeping the encoding as simple as possible consists of just adding a white noise to the encoded values. The code below adds noise generated by stats::runif() to the mean-encoded values, but other options such as stats::rnorm() (noise from a normal distribution) can be useful here. Since white noise is random, we need to set the seed of the pseudo-random number generator (with set.seed()) to obtain constant results every time we run the code below.\nWhen using this method we have to be careful with the amount of noise we add. It should be a harmless fraction of target, small enough to not throw a model off the signal provided by the encoded variable. In our toy case y is between 1 and 7, so something like \u0026ldquo;one percent of the maximum\u0026rdquo; could work well here.\n#maximum noise to add max_noise \u0026lt;- max(yx$y)/100 #set seed for reproducibility set.seed(1) yx |\u0026gt; dplyr::group_by(x) |\u0026gt; dplyr::mutate( x_encoded = mean(y) + runif(n = dplyr::n(), max = max_noise) ) ## # A tibble: 7 Ã 3 ## # Groups: x [3] ## y x x_encoded ## \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; ## 1 1 a 2.02 ## 2 2 a 2.03 ## 3 3 a 2.04 ## 4 4 b 5.06 ## 5 5 b 5.01 ## 6 6 b 5.06 ## 7 7 c 7.07 This method can deal with one-case categories without issues, and does not generate repeated values, but in exchange, we have to be mindful of the amount of noise we add, and we have to set a random seed to ensure reproducibility.\nRandom Encoding A more exotic non-deterministic method of encoding consists of computing the mean and the standard deviation of the target over the category, and then using these values to parameterize a normal distribution to extract randomized values from. This kind of encoding also requires to set the random seed to ensure reproducibility.\nset.seed(1) yx |\u0026gt; dplyr::group_by(x) |\u0026gt; dplyr::mutate( x_encoded = stats::rnorm( n = dplyr::n(), mean = mean(y), sd = ifelse( dplyr::n() == 1, stats::sd(yx$y), #use global sd for one-case groups stats::sd(y) #use local sd for n-cases groups ) ) ) ## # A tibble: 7 Ã 3 ## # Groups: x [3] ## y x x_encoded ## \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; ## 1 1 a 1.37 ## 2 2 a 2.18 ## 3 3 a 1.16 ## 4 4 b 6.60 ## 5 5 b 5.33 ## 6 6 b 4.18 ## 7 7 c 8.05 Rank Encoding plus White Noise This is a little different from all the other methods, because it does not map the categories to values from the target, but to the rank/order of the target means per category. It basically converts the categorical variable into an ordinal one arranged along with the target, and then adds white noise on top to avoid value repetition.\n#maximum noise as function of the number of categories max_noise \u0026lt;- length(unique(yx$x))/100 yx |\u0026gt; dplyr::arrange(y) |\u0026gt; dplyr::group_by(x) |\u0026gt; dplyr::mutate( x_encoded = dplyr::cur_group_id() + runif(n = dplyr::n(), max = max_noise) ) ## # A tibble: 7 Ã 3 ## # Groups: x [3] ## y x x_encoded ## \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; ## 1 1 a 1.02 ## 2 2 a 1.01 ## 3 3 a 1.02 ## 4 4 b 2.03 ## 5 5 b 2.01 ## 6 6 b 2.02 ## 7 7 c 3.03 The Target Encoding Lab The function collinear::target_encoding_lab() implements all these encoding methods, and allows defining different combinations of parameters. It was designed to help understand how they work, and maybe help make choices about what\u0026rsquo;s the right encoding for a given categorical predictor.\nIn the example below, the methods rank, mean, and leave-one-out are computed with white noise of 0 and 0.1 (that\u0026rsquo;s the width of the uniform distribution the noise is extracted from), the mean is also with and without smoothing, and the rnorm is computed using two different multipliers of the standard deviation of the normal distribution computed for each group in the predictor, just to help control the data spread.\nThe function also uses a random seed to generate the same noise across the encoded versions of the predictor to make them as comparable as possible. Every time you change the seed, results using white noise and the rnorm method should change as well.\nyx_encoded \u0026lt;- target_encoding_lab( df = yx, response = \u0026quot;y\u0026quot;, predictors = \u0026quot;x\u0026quot;, white_noise = c(0, 0.1), smoothing = c(0, 2), rnorm_sd_multiplier = c(0.25, 0.5), verbose = TRUE, seed = 1, #for reproducibility replace = FALSE #to replace or not the predictors with their encodings ) ## ## Encoding the predictor: x ## New encoded predictor: 'x__encoded_rank' ## New encoded predictor: 'x__encoded_mean' ## New encoded predictor: 'x__encoded_mean__smoothing_2' ## New encoded predictor: 'x__encoded_loo' ## New encoded predictor: 'x__encoded_rank__noise_0.1' ## New encoded predictor: 'x__encoded_mean__noise_0.1' ## New encoded predictor: 'x__encoded_mean__smoothing_2__noise_0.1' ## New encoded predictor: 'x__encoded_loo__noise_0.1' ## New encoded predictor: 'x__encoded_rnorm__sd_multiplier_0.25' ## New encoded predictor: 'x__encoded_rnorm__sd_multiplier_0.5' dplyr::glimpse(yx_encoded) ## Rows: 7 ## Columns: 12 ## $ y \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 ## $ x \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026quot;a\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;a\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;a\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;b\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;b\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;b\u0026quot;, â¦ ## $ x__encoded_rank \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3 ## $ x__encoded_mean \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; 2, 2, 2, 5, 5, 5, 7 ## $ x__encoded_mean__smoothing_2 \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; 2.8, 2.8, 2.8, 4.6, 4.6, 4.6, â¦ ## $ x__encoded_loo \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; 2.5, 2.0, 1.5, 5.5, 5.0, 4.5, â¦ ## $ x__encoded_rank__noise_0.1 \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; 0.5030858, 0.6752789, 0.999474â¦ ## $ x__encoded_mean__noise_0.1 \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; 1.503086, 1.675279, 1.999475, â¦ ## $ x__encoded_mean__smoothing_2__noise_0.1 \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; 2.303086, 2.475279, 2.799475, â¦ ## $ x__encoded_loo__noise_0.1 \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; 2.003086, 1.675279, 1.499475, â¦ ## $ x__encoded_rnorm__sd_multiplier_0.25 \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; 1.843387, 2.045911, 1.791093, â¦ ## $ x__encoded_rnorm__sd_multiplier_0.5 \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; 1.686773, 2.091822, 1.582186, â¦ yx_encoded |\u0026gt; tidyr::pivot_longer( cols = dplyr::contains(\u0026quot;__encoded\u0026quot;), values_to = \u0026quot;x_encoded\u0026quot; ) |\u0026gt; ggplot() + facet_wrap(\u0026quot;name\u0026quot;) + aes( x = x_encoded, y = y, color = x ) + geom_point(size = 3) + theme_bw() The function also allows to replace a given predictor with their selected encoding. yx_encoded \u0026lt;- collinear::target_encoding_lab( df = yx, response = \u0026quot;y\u0026quot;, predictors = \u0026quot;x\u0026quot;, encoding_methods = \u0026quot;mean\u0026quot;, #selected encoding method smoothing = 2, verbose = TRUE, replace = TRUE ) ## Warning in validate_df(df = df, min_rows = 30): the number of rows in 'df' is ## lower than 30.

Particularly, I try to shed light on their influence on coefficient estimates and their confidence intervals. The Impact of High VIF: I use a small simulation to show how having a model design with a high VIF hinders the identification of predictors with moderate effects, particularly in situations with limited data. Effective VIF Management: I introduce how to use the collinear package and its vif_select() function. to aid in the selection of predictors with low VIF, thereby enhancing model stability and interpretability. Ultimately, this post serves as a comprehensive resource for understanding, interpreting, and managing VIF in the context of linear modeling. It caters to those with a strong command of R and a keen interest in statistical modeling.\nR packages This tutorial requires the development version (\u0026gt;= 1.0.3) of the newly released R package collinear, and a few more.\n#required install.packages(\u0026quot;remotes\u0026quot;) remotes::install_github( repo = \u0026quot;blasbenito/collinear\u0026quot;, ref = \u0026quot;development\u0026quot; ) install.packages(\u0026quot;ranger\u0026quot;) install.packages(\u0026quot;dplyr\u0026quot;) install.packages(\u0026quot;ggplot2\u0026quot;) Example data This post uses the toy data set shipped with the version \u0026gt;= 1.0.3 of the R package collinear. It is a data frame of centered and scaled variables representing a model design of the form y ~ a + b + c + d, where the predictors show varying degrees of relatedness.

When there are predictors that are linear combinations of other predictors. The focus of this post is on the second one.\nWe can say a predictor is a linear combination of other predictors when it can be reasonably predicted from a multiple regression model against all other predictors.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s say we focus on a and fit the multiple regression model a ~ b + c + d. The higher the R-squared of this model, the more confident we are to say that a is a linear combination of b + c + d.\n#model of a against all other predictors abcd_model \u0026lt;- lm( formula = a ~ b + c + d, data = toy ) #r-squared of the a_model abcd_R2 \u0026lt;- summary(abcd_model)$r.squared abcd_R2 ## [1] 0.9381214 Since the R-squared of a against all other predictors is pretty high, it definitely seems that a is a linear combination of the other predictors, and we can conclude that there is multicollinearity in the model design.\nHowever, as informative as this R-squared is, it tells us nothing about the consequences of having multicollinearity in our model design. And this is where Variance Inflation Factors, or VIF for short, come into play.\nWhat are Variance Inflation Factors? The Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) of a predictor is computed as $1/(1 - R^2)$, where \\(R^Â²\\) is the R-squared of the multiple linear regression of the predictor against all other predictors.\nIn the case of a, we just have to apply the VIF expression to the R-squared of the regression model against all other predictors.\nabcd_vif \u0026lt;- 1/(1-abcd_R2) abcd_vif ## [1] 16.16067 This VIF score is relative to the other predictors in the model design. If we change the model design, so does the VIF of all predictors! For example, if we remove c and d from the model design, we are left with this VIF for a:\nab_model \u0026lt;- lm( formula = a ~ b, data = toy ) ab_vif \u0026lt;- 1/(1 - summary(ab_model)$r.squared) ab_vif ## [1] 1.002253 An almost perfect VIF score!\nWe can simplify the VIF computation using collinear::vif_df(), which returns the VIF of a and b at once.\ncollinear::vif_df( df = toy[, c(\u0026quot;a\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;b\u0026quot;)] ) ## predictor vif ## 1 a 1.0023 ## 2 b 1.0023 In plot below, the worst and best VIF scores of a are shown in the context of the relationship between R-squared and VIF, and three VIF thresholds commonly mentioned in the literature. These thresholds are represented as vertical dashed lines at VIF 2.5, 5, and 10, and are used as criteria to control multicollinearity in model designs. I will revisit this topic later in the post.\nWhen the R-squared of the linear regression model is 0, then the VIF expression becomes \\(1/(1 - 0) = 1\\) and returns the minimum possible VIF. On the other end, when R-squared is 1, then we get \\(1/(1 - 1) = Inf\\), the maximum VIF.\nSo far, we have learned that to assess whether the predictor a induces multicollinearity in the model design y ~ a + b + c + d we can compute it\u0026rsquo;s Variance Inflation Factor from the R-squared of the model a ~ b + c + d. We have also learned that if the model design changes, so does the VIF of a. We also know that there are some magic numbers (the VIF thresholds) we can use as reference.\nBut still, we have no indication of what these VIF values actually mean! I will try to fix that in the next section.\nBut really, what are Variance Inflation Factors? Variance Inflation Factors are inherently linked to these fundamental linear modeling concepts:\nCoefficient Estimate (\\(\\hat{\\beta}\\)): The estimated slope of the relationship between a predictor and the response in a linear model. Standard Error (\\(\\text{SE}\\)): Represents the uncertainty around the estimation of the coefficient due to data variability. Significance level (\\(1.96\\)): The acceptable level of error when determining the significance of the coefficient estimate. Here it is simplified to 1.96, the 97.5th percentile of a normal distribution, to approximate a significance level of 0.05. Confidence Interval (\\(CI\\)): The range of values containing the true value of the coefficient estimate withing a certain significance level. These terms are related by the expression to compute the confidence interval of the coefficient estimate:\n$$\\text{CI} = \\beta \\pm 1.96 \\cdot \\text{SE}$$ Let me convert this equation into a small function to compute confidence intervals of coefficient estimates named ci().\nci \u0026lt;- function(b, se){ x \u0026lt;- se * 1.96 as.numeric(c(b-x, b+x)) } #note: stats::confint() which uses t-critical values to compute more precise confidence intervals. Now we are going to look at the coefficient estimate and standard error of a in the model y ~ a + b. We know that a in this model has a vif of 1.0022527.\nyab_model \u0026lt;- lm( formula = y ~ a + b, data = toy ) |\u0026gt; summary() #coefficient estimate and standard error of a a_coef \u0026lt;- yab_model$coefficients[2, 1:2] a_coef ## Estimate Std.

Now we fit the model y ~ a + b + c + d, where a has a vif of 16.1606674. If we follow the definition above, we could now expect an inflation of the confidence interval for a of about 4.0200333. Let\u0026rsquo;s find out if that\u0026rsquo;s the case!\n#model y against all predictors and get summary yabcd_model \u0026lt;- lm( formula = y ~ a + b + c + d, data = toy ) |\u0026gt; summary() #compute confidence interval of a a_ci \u0026lt;- ci( b = yabcd_model$coefficients[\u0026quot;a\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Estimate\u0026quot;], se = yabcd_model$coefficients[\u0026quot;a\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Std. Error\u0026quot;] ) #compute width of confidence interval of a new_width \u0026lt;- diff(a_ci) new_width ## [1] 0.1044793 Now, to find out the inflation factor of this new confidence interval, we divide it by the width of the old one.\nnew_width/old_width ## [1] 4.016101 And the result is VERY CLOSE to the square root of the VIF of a (4.0200333) in this model. Notice that this works because in the model y ~ a + b, a has a perfect VIF of 1.0022527. This demonstration needs a model with a quasi-perfect VIF as reference..\nNow we can confirm our experiment about the meaning of VIF by repeating the exercise with b.\nFirst we compute the VIF of b against a alone, and against a, c, and d, and the expected level of inflation of the confidence interval as the square root of the second VIF.\n#vif of b vs a ba_vif \u0026lt;- collinear::vif_df( df = toy[, c(\u0026quot;a\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;b\u0026quot;)] ) |\u0026gt; dplyr::filter(predictor == \u0026quot;b\u0026quot;) #vif of b vs a c d bacd_vif \u0026lt;- collinear::vif_df( df = toy[, c(\u0026quot;a\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;b\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;c\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;d\u0026quot;)] ) |\u0026gt; dplyr::filter(predictor == \u0026quot;b\u0026quot;) #expeced inflation of the confidence interval sqrt(bacd_vif$vif) ## [1] 2.015515 Now, since b is already in the models y ~ a + b and y ~ a + b + c + d, we just need to extract its coefficients, compute their confidence intervals, and divide one by the other to obtain the\n#compute confidence interval of b in y ~ a + b b_ci_old \u0026lt;- ci( b = yab_model$coefficients[\u0026quot;b\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Estimate\u0026quot;], se = yab_model$coefficients[\u0026quot;b\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Std.

But there is more to that!\nA coefficient estimate divided by its standard error results in the T statistic.

If the claim is wrong (we\u0026rsquo;ll see whey we could be wrong), we fall into a false negative (also Type II Error). p-value \u0026lt;= significance: Evidence to claim that the predictor has an effect on the response. If the claim is wrong, we fall into a false positive (also Type I Error). Now, how does all this matter when talking about the Variance Inflation Factor? Because a high VIF triggers a cascade of effects that increases p-values that can mess up your claims about the importance of the predictors!\nâ VIF âº â Std. Error âº â T statistic âº â p-value âº â false negatives (Type II Error) This cascade becomes a problem when the predictor has a small effect on the response, and the number of cases is small.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s see how this works with b. This predictor has a solid effect on the response y (nonetheless, y was created as a * 0.75 + b * 0.25 + noise). It has a coefficient around 0.25, and a p-value of 0, so there is little to no risk of falling into a false negative when claiming that it is important to explain y, even when its confidence interval is inflated by a factor of two in the full model.\nBut let\u0026rsquo;s try a little experiment. We are going to create many small versions of toy, using only 30 cases selected by chance over a number of iterations, we are going to fit models in which b has a lower and a higher VIF, to monitor its p-values and estimates.\n#number of repetitions repetitions \u0026lt;- 1000 #number of cases to subset in toy sample_size \u0026lt;- 30 #vectors to store results lowvif_p_value \u0026lt;- highvif_p_value \u0026lt;- lowvif_estimate \u0026lt;- highvif_estimate \u0026lt;- vector(length = repetitions) #repetitions for(i in 1:repetitions){ #seed to make randomization reproducible set.seed(i) #toy subset toy.i \u0026lt;- toy[sample(x = 1:nrow(toy), size = sample_size), ] #high vif model highvif_model \u0026lt;- lm( formula = y ~ a + b + c + d, data = toy.i ) |\u0026gt; summary() #gather results of high vif model highvif_p_value[i] \u0026lt;- highvif_model$coefficients[\u0026quot;b\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Pr(\u0026gt;|t|)\u0026quot;] highvif_estimate[i] \u0026lt;- highvif_model$coefficients[\u0026quot;b\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Estimate\u0026quot;] #low_vif_model lowvif_model \u0026lt;- lm( formula = y ~ a + b, data = toy.i ) |\u0026gt; summary() #gather results of lowvif lowvif_p_value[i] \u0026lt;- lowvif_model$coefficients[\u0026quot;b\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Pr(\u0026gt;|t|)\u0026quot;] lowvif_estimate[i] \u0026lt;- lowvif_model$coefficients[\u0026quot;b\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Estimate\u0026quot;] } The plot below shows all p-values of the predictor b for the high and low VIF models across the experiment repetitions.\nAt a significance level of 0.05, the high VIF model rejects b as an important predictor of y on 53.5% of the model repetitions, while the low VIf model does the same on 2.2% of repetitions. This is a clear case of increase in Type II Error (false negatives) under multicollinearity.\nUnder multicollinearity, the probability of overlooking predictors with moderate effects increases dramatically!\nThe plot below shifts the focus towards the coefficient estimates for b across repetitions.\nThe gray vertical line represents the real value of the slope of b, and each dot represents a model repetition. The coefficients of the high VIF model are all over the place when compared to the low VIF one. Probably you have read somewhere that \u0026ldquo;multicollinearity induces model instability\u0026rdquo;, or something similar, and that is exactly what we are seeing here.\nFinding the true effect of a predictor with a moderate effect becomes harder under multicollinearity.\nManaging VIF in a Model Design The second most common form of modeling self-sabotage is having high VIF predictors in a model design, just right after throwing deep learning at tabular problems to see what sticks. I don\u0026rsquo;t have solutions for the deep learning issue, but I have some pointers for the VIFs one: letting things go!. And with things I mean predictors, not the pictures of your old love. There is no rule the more predictors the better rule written anywhere relevant, and letting your model shed some fat is the best way to go here.\nThe collinear package has something to help here. The function collinear::vif_select() is specifically designed to help reduce VIF in a model design. And it can do it in two ways: either using domain knowledge to guide the process, or applying quantitative criteria instead.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s follow the domain knowledge route first. Imagine you know a lot about y, you have read that a is very important to explain it, and you need to discuss this predictor in your results. But you are on the fence about the other predictors, so you don\u0026rsquo;t really care about what others are in the design. You can express such an idea using the argument preference_order, as shown below.\nselected_predictors \u0026lt;- collinear::vif_select( df = toy, predictors = c(\u0026quot;a\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;b\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;c\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;d\u0026quot;), preference_order = \u0026quot;a\u0026quot;, max_vif = 2.5, quiet = TRUE ) selected_predictors ## [1] \u0026quot;a\u0026quot; \u0026quot;b\u0026quot; ## attr(,\u0026quot;validated\u0026quot;) ## [1] TRUE Now you have it, your new model design with a VIF below 2.5 is now y ~ a + b!\nBut what if you get new information and it turns out that d is also a variable of interest? Then you should just modify preference_order to include this new information.\nselected_predictors \u0026lt;- collinear::vif_select( df = toy, predictors = c(\u0026quot;a\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;b\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;c\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;d\u0026quot;), preference_order = c(\u0026quot;a\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;d\u0026quot;), max_vif = 2.5, quiet = TRUE ) selected_predictors ## [1] \u0026quot;a\u0026quot; \u0026quot;d\u0026quot; ## attr(,\u0026quot;validated\u0026quot;) ## [1] TRUE Notice that if your favorite variables are highly correlated, some of them are going to be removed anyway. For example, if a and c are your faves, since they are highly correlated, c is removed.\nselected_predictors \u0026lt;- collinear::vif_select( df = toy, predictors = c(\u0026quot;a\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;b\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;c\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;d\u0026quot;), preference_order = c(\u0026quot;a\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;c\u0026quot;), max_vif = 2.5, quiet = TRUE ) selected_predictors ## [1] \u0026quot;a\u0026quot; \u0026quot;b\u0026quot; ## attr(,\u0026quot;validated\u0026quot;) ## [1] TRUE In either case, you can now build your model while being sure that the coefficients of these predictors are going to be stable and precise.\nNow, what if y is totally new for you, and you have no idea about what to use? In this case, the function collinear::preference_order() helps you rank the predictors following a quantiative criteria, and after that, collinear::vif_select() can use it to reduce your VIFs.\nBy default, collinear::preference_order() calls collinear::f_rsquared() to compute the R-squared between each predictor and the response variable (that\u0026rsquo;s why the argument response is required here), to return a data frame with the variables ranked from \u0026ldquo;better\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;worse\u0026rdquo;.\npreference \u0026lt;- collinear::preference_order( df = toy, response = \u0026quot;y\u0026quot;, predictors = c(\u0026quot;a\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;b\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;c\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;d\u0026quot;), f = collinear::f_r2_pearson, quiet = TRUE ) preference ## response predictor f preference ## 1 y a collinear::f_r2_pearson 0.77600503 ## 2 y c collinear::f_r2_pearson 0.72364944 ## 3 y d collinear::f_r2_pearson 0.59345954 ## 4 y b collinear::f_r2_pearson 0.07343563 Now you can use this data frame as input for the argument preference_order:\nselected_predictors \u0026lt;- collinear::vif_select( df = toy, predictors = c(\u0026quot;a\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;b\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;c\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;d\u0026quot;), preference_order = preference, max_vif = 2.5, quiet = TRUE ) selected_predictors ## [1] \u0026quot;a\u0026quot; \u0026quot;d\u0026quot; ## attr(,\u0026quot;validated\u0026quot;) ## [1] TRUE Now at least you can be sure that the predictors in your model design have low VIF, and were selected taking their correlation with the response as criteria.\nWell, I think that\u0026rsquo;s enough for today.

Variance Inflation Factor analysis (VIF): to identify multicollinearity resulting from predictors being linear combinations of other predictors. Target encoding of categorical predictors: to convert them to numeric using a numeric variable as response (usually a response variable) and handle them as numerics during the multicollinearity filtering. Variable prioritization: method to prioritize predictors during variable selection either using expert knowledge or quantitative criteria. These methods are integrated in the collinear() function, which returns a vector of selected predictors with a controlled multicollinearity.\nselected_variables \u0026lt;- collinear( df, #your data frame response, #name of your response variable predictors, #names of your predictors, preference_order, #your predictors in order of interest max_cor, #maximum bivariate correlation max_vif, #maximum variance inflation factor encoding_method, #method to convert categorical predictors into numerics ) The package contains other functions that may be useful during multicollinearity management:\ncor_select(): like collinear(), but only using pairwise correlations. vif_select(): like collinear(), but only using variance inflation factors. preference_order(): to compute preference order based on univariate models. target_encoding_lab(): to convert categorical predictors into numeric using several methods. cor_df(): to generate a data frame with all pairwise correlation scores. cor_matrix(): to convert a correlation data frame into matrix, or obtain a correlation matrix. vif_df(): to obtain a data frame with all variance inflation factors.

Categorical variables are converted into numeric via target-encoding (with target_encoding_lab()) using a response variable as reference. If the response variable is not provided, categorical variables are ignored.\nInput arguments The function takes these inputs:\ndf: a data frame with predictors, and preferably, a response (more about this later). response: the name of the response variable, only relevant and highly recommended if there are categorical variables within the predictors. predictors: names of predictors involved in the multicollinearity analysis. preference_order: names of the predictors in the user\u0026rsquo;s order of preference. Does not need to name all predictors in predictors! cor_method: usually \u0026ldquo;pearson\u0026rdquo;, but also \u0026ldquo;spearman\u0026rdquo; is accepted. max_cor: maximum correlation allowed between two predictors. max_vif: maximum VIF allowed in a predictor. encoding_method: method used to convert categorical variables into numeric. Only relevant when a response is provided. By default, each group of the categorical variable is encoded with the mean of the response across the group. The code below shows a quick example.

The variable selection results differ because the numeric representations of the categorical variables are rather different between the two options. When no response is provided, the function cor_select() compares categorical predictors against numeric ones by encoding each categorical after each numeric, and compares pairs of categoricals using Cramer\u0026rsquo;s V, implemented in the function cramer_v(). Additionally, Cramer\u0026rsquo;s V values are not directly comparable with Pearson or Spearman correlation scores, and having them together in the same analysis might induce bias during the variable selection. Not using the response argument should always be the last option.\nPreference order The argument preference_order gives the user some control on what predictors should be removed first and what predictors should be kept during the multicollinearity filtering. This argument accepts a vector of predictor names in the order of interest, or the result of the function preference_order(), which allows to define preference order following a quantitative criteria.\nManual preference order Let\u0026rsquo;s start with the former option. Below, the argument preference_order names several predictors that are of importance for a hypothetical analysis. The predictors not in preference_order are ranked by the absolute sum of their correlations with other predictors during the pairwise correlation filtering, and by their VIF during the VIF-based filtering.\nselected_predictors \u0026lt;- cor_select( df = vi, response = \u0026quot;vi_mean\u0026quot;, predictors = vi_predictors, preference_order = c( \u0026quot;soil_temperature_mean\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;soil_temperature_max\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;soil_type\u0026quot; ) ) selected_predictors ## [1] \u0026quot;soil_temperature_mean\u0026quot; \u0026quot;soil_temperature_max\u0026quot; \u0026quot;soil_type\u0026quot; ## [4] \u0026quot;country_population\u0026quot; \u0026quot;topo_elevation\u0026quot; \u0026quot;country_income\u0026quot; ## [7] \u0026quot;country_gdp\u0026quot; \u0026quot;topo_slope\u0026quot; \u0026quot;humidity_range\u0026quot; ## [10] \u0026quot;soil_clay\u0026quot; \u0026quot;topo_diversity\u0026quot; \u0026quot;soil_sand\u0026quot; ## [13] \u0026quot;cloud_cover_range\u0026quot; \u0026quot;region\u0026quot; \u0026quot;soil_soc\u0026quot; ## [16] \u0026quot;rainfall_min\u0026quot; \u0026quot;solar_rad_range\u0026quot; \u0026quot;swi_range\u0026quot; ## [19] \u0026quot;soil_nitrogen\u0026quot; \u0026quot;rainfall_range\u0026quot; \u0026quot;subregion\u0026quot; ## [22] \u0026quot;biogeo_realm\u0026quot; \u0026quot;aridity_index\u0026quot; \u0026quot;solar_rad_max\u0026quot; ## [25] \u0026quot;koppen_group\u0026quot; \u0026quot;soil_temperature_range\u0026quot; \u0026quot;cloud_cover_max\u0026quot; Notice that in the output, two of the variables in preference_order are selected (\u0026ldquo;soil_temperature_mean\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;soil_type\u0026rdquo;), but one was removed (\u0026ldquo;soil_temperature_max\u0026rdquo;). This happens because at some point in the selection, the VIF of \u0026ldquo;soil_temperature_mean\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;soil_temperature_max\u0026rdquo; was higher than max_vif, and the one with lower preference was removed.\nQuantitative preference order The function preference_order() requires the response argument, and takes a function f that returns a value of association between the response and any predictor. This value is then located in the \u0026ldquo;preference\u0026rdquo; column of the function\u0026rsquo;s output.\npreference_rsquared \u0026lt;- preference_order( df = vi, response = \u0026quot;vi_mean\u0026quot;, predictors = vi_predictors, f = f_rsquared, workers = 1 #requires package future and future.apply for more workers ) preference_rsquared ## predictor preference ## 1 biogeo_ecoregion 0.8971347093 ## 2 growing_season_length 0.8076216576 ## 3 koppen_zone 0.8050280970 ## 4 koppen_description 0.7903458680 ## 5 soil_ph 0.7664428862 ## 6 swi_mean 0.7286901614 ## 7 humidity_mean 0.7141389404 ## 8 koppen_group 0.6996959734 ## 9 biogeo_biome 0.6515724588 ## 10 country_name 0.6448346803 ## 11 cloud_cover_mean 0.6338773126 ## 12 soil_type 0.6318025761 ## 13 rainfall_mean 0.6005761078 ## 14 humidity_max 0.5876622545 ## 15 soil_temperature_max 0.5827628810 ## 16 swi_max 0.5813558512 ## 17 cloud_cover_max 0.5758002449 ## 18 humidity_min 0.5705720164 ## 19 growing_season_rainfall 0.5697006759 ## 20 soil_temperature_range 0.5523074848 ## 21 biogeo_realm 0.5031101984 ## 22 solar_rad_max 0.4905225950 ## 23 evapotranspiration_max 0.4814731607 ## 24 rainfall_max 0.4783927311 ## 25 aridity_index 0.4506424015 ## 26 subregion 0.4469207404 ## 27 swi_range 0.4217411381 ## 28 cloud_cover_min 0.4135724066 ## 29 evapotranspiration_range 0.4042241481 ## 30 temperature_range 0.3753489250 ## 31 rainfall_range 0.3545446680 ## 32 temperature_seasonality 0.2499469281 ## 33 rainfall_min 0.2484813976 ## 34 swi_min 0.2406964836 ## 35 solar_rad_mean 0.2140860965 ## 36 soil_nitrogen 0.1872886789 ## 37 continent 0.1818717607 ## 38 temperature_max 0.1589418736 ## 39 region 0.1505256024 ## 40 soil_soc 0.1493958026 ## 41 evapotranspiration_mean 0.1455828419 ## 42 solar_rad_range 0.1300751363 ## 43 temperature_min 0.1222051434 ## 44 cloud_cover_range 0.1216812855 ## 45 soil_temperature_min 0.1018471531 ## 46 topo_diversity 0.0925948262 ## 47 soil_clay 0.0769366113 ## 48 humidity_range 0.0575393339 ## 49 country_income 0.0489946403 ## 50 soil_sand 0.0427943817 ## 51 topo_elevation 0.0424759731 ## 52 growing_season_temperature 0.0239161476 ## 53 topo_slope 0.0203697134 ## 54 soil_temperature_mean 0.0170527033 ## 55 temperature_mean 0.0067479780 ## 56 soil_silt 0.0059316757 ## 57 growing_degree_days 0.0047849144 ## 58 evapotranspiration_min 0.0009965488 ## 59 country_gdp 0.0008850479 ## 60 solar_rad_min 0.0005751350 ## 61 country_population 0.0002513147 The result of preference_order() can be plugged right away into the preference_order argument of collinear.\nselected_predictors \u0026lt;- collinear( df = vi, response = \u0026quot;vi_mean\u0026quot;, predictors = vi_predictors, preference_order = preference_rsquared ) selected_predictors ## [1] \u0026quot;biogeo_ecoregion\u0026quot; \u0026quot;biogeo_realm\u0026quot; ## [3] \u0026quot;solar_rad_max\u0026quot; \u0026quot;rainfall_max\u0026quot; ## [5] \u0026quot;subregion\u0026quot; \u0026quot;swi_range\u0026quot; ## [7] \u0026quot;rainfall_min\u0026quot; \u0026quot;soil_nitrogen\u0026quot; ## [9] \u0026quot;continent\u0026quot; \u0026quot;soil_soc\u0026quot; ## [11] \u0026quot;cloud_cover_range\u0026quot; \u0026quot;topo_diversity\u0026quot; ## [13] \u0026quot;soil_clay\u0026quot; \u0026quot;humidity_range\u0026quot; ## [15] \u0026quot;country_income\u0026quot; \u0026quot;soil_sand\u0026quot; ## [17] \u0026quot;topo_elevation\u0026quot; \u0026quot;growing_season_temperature\u0026quot; ## [19] \u0026quot;topo_slope\u0026quot; \u0026quot;country_gdp\u0026quot; ## [21] \u0026quot;country_population\u0026quot; This variable selection satisfies three conditions at once: maximum correlation between each predictor and the response, maximum pairwise correlation, and maximum VIF.\nThe f argument used by default is the function f_rsquared(), that returns the R-squared between the response and any predictor.\nf_rsquared( x = \u0026quot;growing_season_length\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;vi_mean\u0026quot;, df = vi ) ## [1] 0.8076217 There are two other f functions implemented:\nf_ga_deviance(): returns the explained deviance of a univariate GAM model between the response and each predictor, fitted with the function mgcv::gam().

Summary In this post, I delve into the intricacies of model interpretation under the influence of multicollinearity, and use R and a toy data set to demonstrate how this phenomenon impacts both linear and machine learning models:\nThe section Multicollinearity Explained explains the origin of the word and the nature of the problem. The section Model Interpretation Challenges describes how to create the toy data set, and applies it to Linear Models and Random Forest to explain how multicollinearity can make model interpretation a challenge. The Appendix shows extra examples of linear and machine learning models affected by multicollinearity. I hope you\u0026rsquo;ll enjoy it!\nR packages This tutorial requires the newly released R package collinear, and a few more listed below. The optional ones are used only in the Appendix at the end of the post.\n#required install.packages(\u0026quot;collinear\u0026quot;) install.packages(\u0026quot;ranger\u0026quot;) install.packages(\u0026quot;dplyr\u0026quot;) #optional install.packages(\u0026quot;nlme\u0026quot;) install.packages(\u0026quot;glmnet\u0026quot;) install.packages(\u0026quot;xgboost\u0026quot;) Multicollinearity Explained This cute word comes from the amalgamation of these three Latin terms:\nmultus: adjective meaning many or multiple. con: preposition often converted to co- (as in co-worker) meaning together or mutually. linealis (later converted to linearis): from linea (line), adjective meaning \u0026ldquo;resembling a line\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;belonging to a line\u0026rdquo;, among others. After looking at these serious words, we can come up with a (VERY) liberal translation: \u0026ldquo;several things together in the same line\u0026rdquo;. From here, we just have to replace the word \u0026ldquo;things\u0026rdquo; with \u0026ldquo;predictors\u0026rdquo; (or \u0026ldquo;features\u0026rdquo;, or \u0026ldquo;independent variables\u0026rdquo;, whatever rocks your boat) to build an intuition of the whole meaning of the word in the context of statistical and machine learning modeling.\nIf I lost you there, we can move forward with this idea instead: multicollinearity happens when there are redundant predictors in a modeling dataset. A predictor can be redundant because it shows a high pairwise correlation with other predictors, or because it is a linear combination of other predictors. For example, in a data frame with the columns a, b, and c, if the correlation between a and b is high, we can say that a and b are mutually redundant and there is multicollinearity. But also, if c is the result of a linear operation between a and b, like c \u0026lt;- a + b, or c \u0026lt;- a * 1 + b * 0.5, then we can also say that there is multicollinearity between c, a, and b.\nMulticollinearity is a fact of life that lurks in most data sets. For example, in climate data, variables like temperature, humidity and air pressure are closely intertwined, leading to multicollinearity. That\u0026rsquo;s the case as well in medical research, where parameters like blood pressure, heart rate, and body mass index frequently display common patterns. Economic analysis is another good example, as variables such as Gross Domestic Product (GDP), unemployment rate, and consumer spending often exhibit multicollinearity.\nModel Interpretation Challenges Multicollinearity isn\u0026rsquo;t inherently problematic, but it can be a real buzz kill when the goal is interpreting predictor importance in explanatory models. In the presence of highly correlated predictors, most modelling methods, from the veteran linear models to the fancy gradient boosting, attribute a large part of the importance to only one of the predictors and not the others. In such cases, neglecting multicollinearity will certainly lead to underestimate the relevance of certain predictors.\nLet me go ahead and develop a toy data set to showcase this issue. But let\u0026rsquo;s load the required libraries first.\n#load the collinear package and its example data library(collinear) data(vi) #other required libraries library(ranger) library(dplyr) In the vi data frame shipped with the collinear package, the variables \u0026ldquo;soil_clay\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;humidity_range\u0026rdquo; are not correlated at all (Pearson correlation = -0.06).\nIn the code block below, the dplyr::transmute() command selects and renames them as a and b. After that, the two variables are scaled and centered, and dplyr::mutate() generates a few new columns:\ny: response variable resulting from a linear model where a has a slope of 0.75, b has a slope of 0.25, plus a bit of white noise generated with runif(). c: a new predictor highly correlated with a. d: a new predictor resulting from a linear combination of a and b. set.seed(1) df \u0026lt;- vi |\u0026gt; dplyr::slice_sample(n = 2000) |\u0026gt; dplyr::transmute( a = soil_clay, b = humidity_range ) |\u0026gt; scale() |\u0026gt; as.data.frame() |\u0026gt; dplyr::mutate( y = a * 0.75 + b * 0.25 + runif(n = dplyr::n(), min = -0.5, max = 0.5), c = a + runif(n = dplyr::n(), min = -0.5, max = 0.5), d = (a + b)/2 + runif(n = dplyr::n(), min = -0.5, max = 0.5) ) The Pearson correlation between all pairs of these predictors is shown below.\ncollinear::cor_df( df = df, predictors = c(\u0026quot;a\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;b\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;c\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;d\u0026quot;) ) ## # A tibble: 6 Ã 3 ## x y correlation ## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; ## 1 c a 0.962 ## 2 d b 0.639 ## 3 d a 0.636 ## 4 d c 0.615 ## 5 b a -0.047 ## 6 c b -0.042 At this point, we have are two groups of predictors useful to understand how multicollinearity muddles model interpretation:\nPredictors with no multicollinearity: a and b. Predictors with multicollinearity: a, b, c, and d. In the next two sections and the Appendix, I show how and why model interpretation becomes challenging when multicollinearity is high. Let\u0026rsquo;s start with linear models.\nLinear Models The code below fits multiple linear regression models for both groups of predictors.\n#non-collinear predictors lm_ab \u0026lt;- lm( formula = y ~ a + b, data = df ) #collinear predictors lm_abcd \u0026lt;- lm( formula = y ~ a + b + c + d, data = df ) I would like you to pay attention to the estimates of the predictors a and b for both models. The estimates are the slopes in the linear model, a direct indication of the effect of a predictor over the response.\ncoefficients(lm_ab)[2:3] |\u0026gt; round(4) ## a b ## 0.7477 0.2616 coefficients(lm_abcd)[2:5] |\u0026gt; round(4) ## a b c d ## 0.7184 0.2596 0.0273 0.0039 On one hand, the model with no multicollinearity (lm_ab) achieved a pretty good solution for the coefficients of a and b. Remember that we created y as a * 0.75 + b * 0.25 plus some noise, and that\u0026rsquo;s exactly what the model is telling us here, so the interpretation is pretty straightforward.\nOn the other hand, the model with multicollinearity (lm_abcd) did well with b, but there are a few things in there that make the interpretation harder.\nThe coefficient of a (0.7165) is slightly smaller than the true one (0.75), which could lead us to downplay its relationship with y by a tiny bit. This is kinda OK though, as long as one is not using the model\u0026rsquo;s results to build nukes in the basement. The coefficient of c is so small that it could led us to believe that this predictor not important at all to explain y. But we know that a and c are almost identical copies, so model interpretation here is being definitely muddled by multicollinearity. The coefficient of d is tiny. Since d results from the sum of a and b, we could expect this predictor to be important in explaining y, but it got the shorter end of the stick in this case. It is not that the model it\u0026rsquo;s wrong though. This behavior of the linear model results from the QR decomposition (also QR factorization) applied by functions like lm(), glm(), glmnet::glmnet(), and nlme::gls() to improve numerical stability and computational efficiency, and to\u0026hellip; address multicollinearity in the model predictors.\nThe QR decomposition transforms the original predictors into a set of orthogonal predictors with no multicollinearity. This is the Q matrix, created in a fashion that resembles the way in which a Principal Components Analysis generates uncorrelated components from a set of correlated variables.\nThe code below applies QR decomposition to our multicollinear predictors, extracts the Q matrix, and shows the correlation between the new versions of a, b, c, and d.\n#predictors names predictors \u0026lt;- c(\u0026quot;a\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;b\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;c\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;d\u0026quot;) #QR decomposition of predictors df.qr \u0026lt;- qr(df[, predictors]) #extract Q matrix df.q \u0026lt;- qr.Q(df.qr) colnames(df.q) \u0026lt;- predictors #correlation between transformed predictors collinear::cor_df(df = df.q) ## # A tibble: 6 Ã 3 ## x y correlation ## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; ## 1 d c 0 ## 2 c b 0 ## 3 d b 0 ## 4 d a 0 ## 5 c a 0 ## 6 b a 0 The new set of predictors we are left with after the QR decomposition have exactly zero correlation! And now they are not our original predictors anymore, and have a different interpretation:\na is now \u0026ldquo;the part of a not in b, c, and d\u0026rdquo;. b is now \u0026ldquo;the part of b not in a, c, and d\u0026rdquo;. \u0026hellip;and so on\u0026hellip; The result of the QR decomposition can be plugged into the solve() function along with the response vector to estimate the coefficients of the linear model.\nsolve(a = df.qr, b = df$y) |\u0026gt; round(4) ## a b c d ## 0.7189 0.2595 0.0268 0.0040 These are almost exactly the ones we got for our model with multicollinearity. In the end, the coefficients resulting from a linear model are not those of the original predictors, but the ones of their uncorrelated versions generated by the QR decomposition.\nBut this is not the only issue of model interpretability under multicollinearity. Let\u0026rsquo;s take a look at the standard errors of the estimates. These are a measure of the coefficient estimation uncertainty, and are used to compute the p-values of the estimates. As such, they are directly linked with the \u0026ldquo;statistical significance\u0026rdquo; (whatever that means) of the predictors within the model.\nThe code below shows the standard errors of the model without and with multicollinearity.\nsummary(lm_ab)$coefficients[, \u0026quot;Std. Error\u0026quot;][2:3] |\u0026gt; round(4) ## a b ## 0.0066 0.0066 summary(lm_abcd)$coefficients[, \u0026quot;Std. Error\u0026quot;][2:5] |\u0026gt; round(4) ## a b c d ## 0.0267 0.0134 0.0232 0.0230 These standard errors of the model with multicollinearity are an order of magnitude higher than the ones of the model without multicollinearity.\nSince our toy dataset is relatively large (2000 cases) and the relationship between the response and a few of the predictors pretty robust, there are no real issues arising, as these differences in estimation precision are not enough to change the p-values of the estimates. However, in a small data set with high multicollinearity and a weaker relationship between the response and the predictors, standard errors of the estimate become wide, which increases p-values and reduces \u0026ldquo;significance\u0026rdquo;. Such a situation might lead us to believe that a predictor does not explain the response, when in fact it does. And this, again, is a model interpretability issue caused by multicollinearity.\nAt the end of this post there is an appendix with code examples of other types of linear models that use QR decomposition and become challenging to interpret in the presence of multicollinearity. Play with them as you please!\nNow, let\u0026rsquo;s take a look at how multicollinearity can also mess up the interpretation of a commonly used machine learning algorithm.\nRandom Forest It is not uncommon to hear something like \u0026ldquo;random forest is insensitive to multicollinearity\u0026rdquo;. Actually, I cannot confirm nor deny that I have said that before. Anyway, it is kind of true if one is focused on prediction problmes. However, when the aim is interpreting predictor importance scores, then one has to be mindful about multicollinearity as well.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s see an example. The code below fits two random forest models with our two sets of predictors.\n#non-collinear predictors rf_ab \u0026lt;- ranger::ranger( formula = y ~ a + b, data = df, importance = \u0026quot;permutation\u0026quot;, seed = 1 #for reproducibility ) #collinear predictors rf_abcd \u0026lt;- ranger::ranger( formula = y ~ a + b + c + d, data = df, importance = \u0026quot;permutation\u0026quot;, seed = 1 ) Let\u0026rsquo;s take a look at the prediction error the two models on the out-of-bag data. While building each regression tree, Random Forest leaves a random subset of the data out. Then, each case gets a prediction from all trees that had it in the out-of-bag data, and the prediction error is averaged across all cases to get the numbers below.\nrf_ab$prediction.error ## [1] 0.1026779 rf_abcd$prediction.error ## [1] 0.1035678 According to these numbers, these two models are basically equivalent in their ability to predict our response y.\nBut now, you noticed that I set the argument importance to \u0026ldquo;permutation\u0026rdquo;. Permutation importance quantifies how the out-of-bag error increases when a predictor is permuted across all trees where the predictor is used. It is pretty robust importance metric that bears no resemblance whatsoever with the coefficients of a linear model. Think of it as a very different way to answer the question \u0026ldquo;what variables are important in this model?\u0026rdquo;.\nThe permutation importance scores of the two random forest models are show below.\nrf_ab$variable.importance |\u0026gt; round(4) ## a b ## 1.0702 0.1322 rf_abcd$variable.importance |\u0026gt; round(4) ## a b c d ## 0.5019 0.0561 0.1662 0.0815 There is one interesting detail here. The predictor a has a permutation error three times higher than c in the second model, even though we could expect them to be similar due to their very high correlation. There are two reasons for this mismatch:\nRandom Forest is much more sensitive to the white noise in c than linear models, especially in the deep parts of the regression trees, due to local (within-split data) decoupling with the response y. In consequence, it does not get selected as often as a in these deeper areas of the trees, and has less overall importance. The predictor c competes with d, that has around 50% of the information in c (and a). If we remove d from the model, then the permutation importance of c doubles up. Then, with d in the model, we underestimate the real importance of c due to multicollinearity alone. rf_abc \u0026lt;- ranger::ranger( formula = y ~ a + b + c, data = df, importance = \u0026quot;permutation\u0026quot;, seed = 1 ) rf_abc$variable.importance |\u0026gt; round(4) ## a b c ## 0.5037 0.1234 0.3133 With all that in mind, we can conclude that interpreting importance scores in Random Forest models is challenging when multicollinearity is high. But Random Forest is not the only machine learning affected by this issue. In the Appendix below I have left an example with Extreme Gradient Boosting so you can play with it.\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s all for now, folks, I hope you found this post useful!\nAppendix This section shows several extra examples of linear and machine learning models you can play with.\nOther linear models using QR decomposition As I commented above, many linear modeling functions use QR decomposition, and you will have to be careful interpreting model coefficients in the presence of strong multicollinearity in the predictors.\nHere I show several examples with glm() (Generalized Linear Models), nlme::gls() (Generalized Least Squares), and glmnet::cv.glmnet() (Elastic Net Regularization). In all them, no matter how fancy, the interpretation of coefficients becomes tricky when multicollinearity is high.\nGeneralized Linear Models with glm()\n#Generalized Linear Models #non-collinear predictors glm_ab \u0026lt;- glm( formula = y ~ a + b, data = df ) round(coefficients(glm_ab), 4)[2:3] ## a b ## 0.7477 0.2616 #collinear predictors glm_abcd \u0026lt;- glm( formula = y ~ a + b + c + d, data = df ) round(coefficients(glm_abcd), 4)[2:5] ## a b c d ## 0.7184 0.2596 0.0273 0.0039 Generalized Least Squares with nlme::gls()\nlibrary(nlme) ## ## Attaching package: 'nlme' ## The following object is masked from 'package:dplyr': ## ## collapse #Generalized Least Squares #non-collinear predictors gls_ab \u0026lt;- nlme::gls( model = y ~ a + b, data = df ) round(coefficients(gls_ab), 4)[2:3] ## a b ## 0.7477 0.2616 #collinear predictors gls_abcd \u0026lt;- nlme::gls( model = y ~ a + b + c + d, data = df ) round(coefficients(gls_abcd), 4)[2:5] ## a b c d ## 0.7184 0.2596 0.0273 0.0039 Elastic Net Regularization and Lasso penalty with glmnet::glmnet()\nlibrary(glmnet) ## Loading required package: Matrix ## Loaded glmnet 4.1-8 #Elastic net regularization with Lasso penalty #non-collinear predictors glmnet_ab \u0026lt;- glmnet::cv.glmnet( x = as.matrix(df[, c(\u0026quot;a\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;b\u0026quot;)]), y = df$y, alpha = 1 #lasso penalty ) round(coef(glmnet_ab$glmnet.fit, s = glmnet_ab$lambda.min), 4)[2:3] ## [1] 0.7438 0.2578 #collinear predictors glmnet_abcd \u0026lt;- glmnet::cv.glmnet( x = as.matrix(df[, c(\u0026quot;a\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;b\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;c\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;d\u0026quot;)]), y = df$y, alpha = 1 ) #notice that the lasso regularization nuked the coefficients of predictors b and c round(coef(glmnet_abcd$glmnet.fit, s = glmnet_abcd$lambda.min), 4)[2:5] ## [1] 0.7101 0.2507 0.0267 0.0149 Extreme Gradient Boosting under multicollinearity Gradient Boosting models trained with multicollinear predictors behave in a way similar to linear models with QR decomposition.

We also characterized the range of environmental conditions that determine their presence, which is restricted to narrow and specific soil and climatic conditions. Areas showing FC-like vegetation patterns also had more stable productivity over time than surrounding areas having non-FC patterns.

It does so by generating spatial predictors that help the model \u0026ldquo;understand\u0026rdquo; the spatial structure of the training data with the end goal of minimizing the spatial autocorrelation of the model residuals and offering honest variable importance scores.\nTwo main methods to generate spatial predictors from the distance matrix of the data points are implemented in the package:\nMoran\u0026rsquo;s Eigenvector Maps (Dray, Legendre, and Peres-Neto 2006). Distance matrix columns as explanatory variables (Hengl et al. 2018). The package is designed to minimize the code required to fit a spatial model from a training dataset, the names of the response and the predictors, and a distance matrix, as shown below.\nspatial.model \u0026lt;- spatialRF::rf_spatial( data = your_dataframe, dependent.variable.name = \u0026quot;your_response_variable\u0026quot;, predictor.variable.names = c(\u0026quot;predictor1\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;predictor2\u0026quot;, ..., \u0026quot;predictorN\u0026quot;), distance.matrix = your_distance_matrix ) spatialRF uses the fast and efficient ranger package under the hood (Wright and Ziegler 2017), so please, cite the ranger package when using spatialRF!\nThis package also provides tools to identify potentially interesting variable interactions, tune random forest hyperparameters, assess model performance on spatially independent data folds, and examine the resulting models via importance plots, response curves, and response surfaces.\nDevelopment This package is reaching its final form, and big changes are not expected at this stage. However, it has many functions, and even though all them have been tested, only one dataset has been used for those tests. You will find bugs, and something will go wrong almost surely. If you have time to report bugs, please, do so in any of the following ways:\nOpen a new issue in the Issues GitHub page of the package. Send me an email explaining the issue and the error messages with enough detail at blasbenito at gmail dot com. Send a direct message to my twitter account explaining the issue. I will do my best to solve any issues ASAP!\nApplications The goal of spatialRF is to help fitting explanatory spatial regression, where the target is to understand how a set of predictors and the spatial structure of the data influences response variable. Therefore, the spatial analyses implemented in the package can be applied to any spatial dataset, regular or irregular, with a sample size between ~100 and ~5000 cases (the higher end will depend on the RAM memory available), a quantitative or binary (values 0 and 1) response variable, and a more or less large set of predictive variables.\nAll functions but rf_spatial() work with non-spatial data as well if the arguments distance.matrix and distance.thresholds are not provided In such case, the number of training cases is no longer limited by the size of the distance matrix, and models can be trained with hundreds of thousands of rows. In such case, the spatial autocorrelation of the model\u0026rsquo;s residuals is not assessed.\nHowever, when the focus is on fitting spatial models, and due to the nature of the spatial predictors used to represent the spatial structure of the training data, there are many things this package cannot do:\nPredict model results over raster data.\nPredict a model result over another region with a different spatial structure.\nWork with \u0026ldquo;big data\u0026rdquo;, whatever that means.\nImputation or extrapolation (it can be done, but models based on spatial predictors are hardly transferable).\nTake temporal autocorrelation into account (but this is something that might be implemented later on).\nIf after considering these limitations you are still interested, follow me, I will show you how it works.\nCitation There is a paper in the making about this package. In the meantime, if you find it useful for your academic work, please cite the ranger package as well, it is the true core of spatialRF!\nMarvin N.

Journal of Statistical Software, 77(1), 1-17. doi:10.18637/jss.v077.i01\nBlas M. Benito (2021). spatialRF: Easy Spatial Regression with Random Forest. R package version 1.1.0. doi: 10.5281/zenodo.4745208. url: https://blasbenito.github.io/spatialRF/\nInstall The version 1.1.3 can be installed from CRAN:\ninstall.packages(\u0026quot;spatialRF\u0026quot;) The package can also be installed from GitHub as follows. There are several branches in the repository:\nmain: latest stable version (1.1.0 currently). development: development version, usually very broken. v.1.0.9 to v.1.1.2: archived versions. remotes::install_github( repo = \u0026quot;blasbenito/spatialRF\u0026quot;, ref = \u0026quot;main\u0026quot;, force = TRUE, quiet = TRUE ) There are a few other libraries that will be useful during this tutorial.\nlibrary(spatialRF) library(kableExtra) library(rnaturalearth) library(rnaturalearthdata) library(tidyverse) library(randomForestExplainer) library(pdp) Data requirements The data required to fit random forest models with spatialRF must fulfill several conditions:\nThe input format is data.frame. At the moment, tibbles are not fully supported. The number of rows must be somewhere between 100 and ~5000, at least if your target is fitting spatial models. This limitation comes from the fact that the distance matrix grows very fast with an increasing number of training records, so for large datasets, there might not be enough RAM in your machine. The number of predictors should be larger than 3. Fitting a Random Forest model is moot otherwise. Factors in the response or the predictors are not explicitly supported in the package. They may work, or they won\u0026rsquo;t, but in any case, I designed this package for quantitative data alone. However, binary responses with values 0 and 1 are partially supported. Must be free of NA. You can check if there are NA records with sum(apply(df, 2, is.na)). If the result is larger than 0, then just execute df \u0026lt;- na.omit(df) to remove rows with empty cells. Columns cannot have zero variance. This condition can be checked with apply(df, 2, var) == 0. Columns yielding TRUE should be removed. Columns must not yield NaN or Inf when scaled. You can check each condition with sum(apply(scale(df), 2, is.nan)) and sum(apply(scale(df), 2, is.infinite)). If higher than 0, you can find what columns are giving issues with sapply(as.data.frame(scale(df)), function(x)any(is.nan(x))) and sapply(as.data.frame(scale(df)), function(x)any(is.infinite(x))). Any column yielding TRUE will generate issues while trying to fit models with spatialRF. Example data The package includes an example dataset that fulfills the conditions mentioned above, named plant_richness_df. It is a data frame with plant species richness and predictors for 227 ecoregions in the Americas, and a distance matrix among the ecoregion edges named, well, distance_matrix.\nThe package follows a convention throughout functions:\nThe argument data requires a training data frame. The argument dependent.variable.name is the column name of the response variable. The argument predictor.variable.names contains the column names of the predictors. The argument xy takes a data frame or matrix with two columns named \u0026ldquo;x\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;y\u0026rdquo;, in that order, with the case coordinates. The argument distance.matrix requires a matrix of distances between the cases in data. The argument distance.thresholds is a numeric vector of distances at with spatial autocorrelation wants to be computed. It is convenient to define these arguments at the beginning of the workflow.\n#loading training data and distance matrix from the package data(plant_richness_df) data(distance_matrix) #names of the response variable and the predictors dependent.variable.name \u0026lt;- \u0026quot;richness_species_vascular\u0026quot; predictor.variable.names \u0026lt;- colnames(plant_richness_df)[5:21] #coordinates of the cases xy \u0026lt;- plant_richness_df[, c(\u0026quot;x\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;y\u0026quot;)] #distance matrix distance.matrix \u0026lt;- distance_matrix #distance thresholds (same units as distance_matrix) distance.thresholds \u0026lt;- c(0, 1000, 2000, 4000, 8000) #random seed for reproducibility random.seed \u0026lt;- 1 The response variable of plant_richness_df is \u0026ldquo;richness_species_vascular\u0026rdquo;, that represents the total count of vascular plant species found on each ecoregion. The figure below shows the centroids of each ecoregion along with their associated value of the response variable.\nworld \u0026lt;- rnaturalearth::ne_countries( scale = \u0026quot;medium\u0026quot;, returnclass = \u0026quot;sf\u0026quot; ) ggplot2::ggplot() + ggplot2::geom_sf( data = world, fill = \u0026quot;white\u0026quot; ) + ggplot2::geom_point( data = plant_richness_df, ggplot2::aes( x = x, y = y, color = richness_species_vascular ), size = 2.5 ) + ggplot2::scale_color_viridis_c( direction = -1, option = \u0026quot;F\u0026quot; ) + ggplot2::theme_bw() + ggplot2::labs(color = \u0026quot;Plant richness\u0026quot;) + ggplot2::scale_x_continuous(limits = c(-170, -30)) + ggplot2::scale_y_continuous(limits = c(-58, 80)) + ggplot2::ggtitle(\u0026quot;Plant richness of the American ecoregions\u0026quot;) + ggplot2::xlab(\u0026quot;Longitude\u0026quot;) + ggplot2::ylab(\u0026quot;Latitude\u0026quot;) The predictors (columns 5 to 21) represent diverse factors that may influence plant richness such as sampling bias, the area of the ecoregion, climatic variables, human presence and impact, topography, geographical fragmentation, and features of the neighbors of each ecoregion. The figure below shows the scatterplots of the response variable (y axis) against each predictor (x axis).\nNote: Every plotting function in the package now allows changing the colors of their main features via specific arguments such as point.color, line.color, or fill.color.\nspatialRF::plot_training_df( data = plant_richness_df, dependent.variable.name = dependent.variable.name, predictor.variable.names = predictor.variable.names, ncol = 3, point.color = viridis::viridis(100, option = \u0026quot;F\u0026quot;), line.color = \u0026quot;gray30\u0026quot; ) The function plot_training_df_moran() helps assessing the spatial autocorrelation of the response variable and the predictors across different distance thresholds. Low Moran\u0026rsquo;s I and p-values equal or larger than 0.05 indicate that there is no spatial autocorrelation for the given variable and distance threshold.\nspatialRF::plot_training_df_moran( data = plant_richness_df, dependent.variable.name = dependent.variable.name, predictor.variable.names = predictor.variable.names, distance.matrix = distance.matrix, distance.thresholds = distance.thresholds, fill.color = viridis::viridis( 100, option = \u0026quot;F\u0026quot;, direction = -1 ), point.color = \u0026quot;gray40\u0026quot; ) Reducing multicollinearity in the predictors The functions auto_cor() and auto_vif() help reduce redundancy in the predictors by using different criteria (bivariate R squared vs. variance inflation factor), while allowing the user to define an order of preference, which can be based either on domain expertise or on a quantitative assessment (e.g., order of preference based on variable importance scores or model coefficients). The preference order is defined as a character vector in the preference.order argument of both functions, and does not need to include the names of all predictors, but just the ones the user would like to keep in the analysis.\nNotice that I have set cor.threshold and vif.threshold to low values because the predictors in plant_richness_df already have little multicollinearity,. The default values (cor.threshold = 0.75 and vif.threshold = 5) should work well when combined together for any other set of predictors.\npreference.order \u0026lt;- c( \u0026quot;climate_bio1_average_X_bias_area_km2\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;climate_aridity_index_average\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;climate_hypervolume\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;climate_bio1_average\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;climate_bio15_minimum\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;bias_area_km2\u0026quot; ) predictor.variable.names \u0026lt;- spatialRF::auto_cor( x = plant_richness_df[, predictor.variable.names], cor.threshold = 0.6, preference.order = preference.order ) %\u0026gt;% spatialRF::auto_vif( vif.threshold = 2.5, preference.order = preference.order ) ## [auto_cor()]: Removed variables: human_footprint_average ## [auto_vif()]: Variables are not collinear.

The upper panel in the plot plot above shows the relationship between the interaction and the response variable. It also indicates the gain in R squared (+R2), the importance, in percentage, when used in a model along the other predictors (Imp. (%)), and the maximum Pearson correlation of the interaction with the predictors. The violin-plot shows a comparison of the model with and without the selected interaction made via spatial cross-validation using 100 repetitions (see rf_evaluate() and rf_compare() for further details).\nThe function also returns a data frame with all the interactions considered. The columns are:\ninteraction.name: Interactions computed via multiplication are named a..x..b, while interactions computed via PCA are named a..pca..b. interaction.importance: Importance of the interaction expressed as a percentage. If interaction.importance == 100, that means that the interaction is the most important predictor in the model fitted with the interaction and the predictors named in predictor.variable.names. interaction.metric.gain: Difference in R squared (or AUC for models fitting a binary response) between a model with and a model without the interaction. max.cor.with.predictors: The maximum Pearson correlation of the interaction with the predictors named in predictor.variable.names. Gives an idea of the amount of multicollinearity the interaction introduces in the model. variable.a.name and variable.b.name: Names of the predictors involved in the interaction. selected: TRUE if the interaction fulfills the selection criteria (importance higher than a threshold, positive gain in R squared or AUC, and Pearson correlation with other predictors lower than a threshold). The selected interactions have a correlation among themselves always lower than the value of the argument cor.threshold. kableExtra::kbl( head(interactions$screening, 10), format = \u0026quot;html\u0026quot; ) %\u0026gt;% kableExtra::kable_paper(\u0026quot;hover\u0026quot;, full_width = F) interaction.name interaction.importance interaction.metric.gain max.cor.with.predictors variable.a.name variable.b.name selected bias_area_km2..x..bias_species_per_record 60.779 0.096 0.5962899 bias_area_km2 bias_species_per_record TRUE climate_bio1_average..pca..human_population_density 97.944 0.067 0.3369664 climate_bio1_average human_population_density TRUE climate_bio1_average..pca..neighbors_count 98.742 0.049 0.2441858 climate_bio1_average neighbors_count TRUE climate_bio1_average..pca..neighbors_percent_shared_edge 84.196 0.066 0.2215337 climate_bio1_average neighbors_percent_shared_edge TRUE human_population..x..bias_species_per_record 66.512 0.021 0.5462406 human_population bias_species_per_record TRUE climate_bio1_average..pca..bias_species_per_record 70.082 0.018 0.3469834 climate_bio1_average bias_species_per_record TRUE bias_area_km2..pca..neighbors_percent_shared_edge 62.678 0.029 0.3046471 bias_area_km2 neighbors_percent_shared_edge TRUE climate_hypervolume..x..human_population_density 49.367 -0.006 0.5599486 climate_hypervolume human_population_density FALSE neighbors_count..pca..neighbors_percent_shared_edge 63.808 0.016 0.1584006 neighbors_count neighbors_percent_shared_edge TRUE bias_area_km2..pca..neighbors_count 58.662 0.012 0.2166191 bias_area_km2 neighbors_count TRUE The function returns a data frame with the response variables, the predictors, and the selected interactions that can be used right away as a training data frame. However, the function cannot say whether an interaction makes sense, and it is up to the user to choose wisely whether to select an interaction or not. In this particular case, and just for the sake of simplicity, we will be using the resulting data frame as training data.\n#adding interaction column to the training data plant_richness_df \u0026lt;- interactions$data #adding interaction name to predictor.variable.names predictor.variable.names \u0026lt;- interactions$predictor.variable.names Fitting a non-spatial Random Forest model with rf() The function rf() is a convenient wrapper for ranger::ranger() used in every modelling function of the spatialRF package. It takes the training data, the names of the response and the predictors, and optionally (to assess the spatial autocorrelation of the residuals), the distance matrix, and a vector of distance thresholds (in the same units as the distances in distance_matrix).\nThese distance thresholds are the neighborhoods at which the model will check the spatial autocorrelation of the residuals. Their values may depend on the spatial scale of the data, and the ecological system under study.\nNotice that here I plug the object predictor.variable.names, output of auto_cor() and auto_vif(), directly into the predictor.variable.names argument of the rf() function to fit a random forest model.\nmodel.non.spatial \u0026lt;- spatialRF::rf( data = plant_richness_df, dependent.variable.name = dependent.variable.name, predictor.variable.names = predictor.variable.names, distance.matrix = distance.matrix, distance.thresholds = distance.thresholds, xy = xy, #not needed by rf, but other functions read it from the model seed = random.seed, verbose = FALSE ) The output is a list with several slots containing the information required to interpret the model. The information available in these slots can be plotted (functions named plot_...()), printed to screen (print_...()) and captured for further analyses (get_...()).\nResiduals The slot residuals (model.non.spatial$residuals) stores the values of the residuals and the results of the normality and spatial autocorrelation tests, and its content can be plotted with plot_residuals_diagnostics().\nspatialRF::plot_residuals_diagnostics( model.non.spatial, verbose = FALSE ) The upper panels show the results of the normality test (interpretation in the title), the middle panel shows the relationship between the residuals and the fitted values, important to understand the behavior of the residuals, and the lower panel shows the Moran\u0026rsquo;s I of the residuals across distance thresholds and their respective p-values (positive for 0 and 1000 km).\nVariable importance Global variable importance The slot importance (model.non.spatial$variable.importance) contains the variable importance scores. These can be plotted with plot_importance(), printed with print_importance(), and the dataframe retrieved with get_importance()\nspatialRF::plot_importance( model.non.spatial, verbose = FALSE ) Variable importance represents the increase in mean error (computed on the out-of-bag data) across trees when a predictor is permuted. Values lower than zero would indicate that the variable performs worse than a random one.\nIf the argument scaled.importance = TRUE is used, the variable importance scores are computed from the scaled data, making the importance scores easier to compare across different models.\nThe package randomForestExplainer offers a couple of interesting options to deepen our understanding on variable importance scores. The first one is measure_importance(), which analyzes the forest to find out the average minimum tree depth at which each variable can be found (mean_min_depth), the number of nodes in which a variable was selected to make a split (no_of_nodes), the number of times the variable was selected as the first one to start a tree (times_a_root), and the probability of a variable to be in more nodes than what it would be expected by chance (p_value).\nimportance.df \u0026lt;- randomForestExplainer::measure_importance( model.non.spatial, measures = c(\u0026quot;mean_min_depth\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;no_of_nodes\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;times_a_root\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;p_value\u0026quot;) ) kableExtra::kbl( importance.df %\u0026gt;% dplyr::arrange(mean_min_depth) %\u0026gt;% dplyr::mutate(p_value = round(p_value, 4)), format = \u0026quot;html\u0026quot; ) %\u0026gt;% kableExtra::kable_paper(\u0026quot;hover\u0026quot;, full_width = F) variable mean_min_depth no_of_nodes times_a_root p_value climate_bio1_average..pca..neighbors_count 2.811087 2098 86 0.0000 human_population 2.989940 2222 51 0.0000 climate_bio1_average 3.117996 1979 57 0.0000 climate_hypervolume 3.200133 2072 44 0.0000 climate_bio1_average..pca..human_population_density 3.201070 1781 64 0.4909 bias_area_km2..x..bias_species_per_record 3.379787 1797 46 0.3406 human_population_density 3.454233 1900 23 0.0020 bias_species_per_record 3.564676 2321 2 0.0000 bias_area_km2..pca..neighbors_percent_shared_edge 3.959485 1712 33 0.9519 human_population..x..bias_species_per_record 3.977952 1780 32 0.5006 bias_area_km2 4.186849 1800 10 0.3144 neighbors_count 4.204326 1325 29 1.0000 topography_elevation_average 4.306636 1732 0 0.8795 neighbors_percent_shared_edge 4.409251 1700 5 0.9749 neighbors_area 4.643590 1621 2 1.0000 fragmentation_cohesion 4.770930 1518 8 1.0000 climate_velocity_lgm_average 4.845155 1658 3 0.9986 climate_aridity_index_average 4.858302 1682 3 0.9919 landcover_herbs_percent_average 4.984346 1656 0 0.9988 climate_bio15_minimum 5.057002 1552 2 1.0000 fragmentation_division 5.229187 1468 0 1.0000 Contribution of predictors to model transferability The new function rf_importance() offers a way to assess to what extent each predictor contributes to model transferability (predictive ability on independent spatial folds measured with rf_evaluate(), see below). It does so by comparing the performance of the full model with models fitted without each one of the predictors. The difference in performance between the full model and a model without a given predictor represents the contribution of such predictor to model transferability.\nmodel.non.spatial \u0026lt;- spatialRF::rf_importance( model = model.non.spatial ) The function results are added to the \u0026ldquo;importance\u0026rdquo; slot of the model.\nnames(model.non.spatial$importance) ## [1] \u0026quot;per.variable\u0026quot; \u0026quot;local\u0026quot; \u0026quot;oob.per.variable.plot\u0026quot; ## [4] \u0026quot;cv.per.variable.plot\u0026quot; The data frame \u0026ldquo;per.variable\u0026rdquo; contains the columns \u0026ldquo;importance.cv\u0026rdquo; (median importance), \u0026ldquo;importance.cv.mad\u0026rdquo; (median absolute deviation), \u0026ldquo;importance.cv.percent\u0026rdquo; (median importance in percentage), and \u0026ldquo;importance.cv.percent.mad\u0026rdquo; (median absolute deviation of the importance in percent). The ggplot object \u0026ldquo;cv.per.variable.plot\u0026rdquo; contains the importance plot with the median and the median absolute deviation shown above.\nThe importance computed by random forest on the out-of-bag data by permutating each predictor (as computed by rf()) and the contribution of each predictor to model transferability (as computed by rf_importance()) show a moderate correlation, indicating that both importance measures capture different aspects of the effect of the variables on the model results.\nmodel.non.spatial$importance$per.variable %\u0026gt;% ggplot2::ggplot() + ggplot2::aes( x = importance.oob, y = importance.cv ) + ggplot2::geom_point(size = 3) + ggplot2::theme_bw() + ggplot2::xlab(\u0026quot;Importance (out-of-bag)\u0026quot;) + ggplot2::ylab(\u0026quot;Contribution to transferability\u0026quot;) + ggplot2::geom_smooth(method = \u0026quot;lm\u0026quot;, formula = y ~ x, color = \u0026quot;red4\u0026quot;) Local variable importance Random forest also computes the average increase in error when a variable is permuted for each case.

Building the partial dependency curve of a predictor requires setting the other predictors to their quantiles (0.1, 0.5, and 0.9 by default). This helps to understand how the response curve of a variable changes when all the other variables have low, centered, or high values. The function also allows to see the training data\nspatialRF::plot_response_curves( model.non.spatial, quantiles = c(0.1, 0.5, 0.9), line.color = viridis::viridis( 3, #same number of colors as quantiles option = \u0026quot;F\u0026quot;, end = 0.9 ), ncol = 3, show.data = TRUE ) Setting the argument quantiles to 0.5 and setting show.data to FALSE (default optioin) accentuates the shape of the response curves.\nspatialRF::plot_response_curves( model.non.spatial, quantiles = 0.5, ncol = 3 ) The package pdp provides a general way to plot partial dependence plots.\npdp::partial( model.non.spatial, train = plant_richness_df, pred.var = \u0026quot;climate_bio1_average\u0026quot;, plot = TRUE, grid.resolution = 200 ) If you need to do your own plots in a different way, the function get_response_curves() returns a data frame with the required data.\nreponse.curves.df \u0026lt;- spatialRF::get_response_curves(model.non.spatial) kableExtra::kbl( head(reponse.curves.df, n = 10), format = \u0026quot;html\u0026quot; ) %\u0026gt;% kableExtra::kable_paper(\u0026quot;hover\u0026quot;, full_width = F) response predictor quantile model predictor.name response.name 3081.941 -4.428994 0.1 1 climate_bio1_average..pca..human_population_density richness_species_vascular 3081.941 -4.393562 0.1 1 climate_bio1_average..pca..human_population_density richness_species_vascular 3081.941 -4.358129 0.1 1 climate_bio1_average..pca..human_population_density richness_species_vascular 3081.941 -4.322697 0.1 1 climate_bio1_average..pca..human_population_density richness_species_vascular 3081.941 -4.287265 0.1 1 climate_bio1_average..pca..human_population_density richness_species_vascular 3081.941 -4.251833 0.1 1 climate_bio1_average..pca..human_population_density richness_species_vascular 3081.941 -4.216400 0.1 1 climate_bio1_average..pca..human_population_density richness_species_vascular 3081.941 -4.180968 0.1 1 climate_bio1_average..pca..human_population_density richness_species_vascular 3081.941 -4.145536 0.1 1 climate_bio1_average..pca..human_population_density richness_species_vascular 3081.941 -4.110104 0.1 1 climate_bio1_average..pca..human_population_density richness_species_vascular Interactions between two variables can be plotted with plot_response_surface()\nspatialRF::plot_response_surface( model.non.spatial, a = \u0026quot;climate_bio1_average\u0026quot;, b = \u0026quot;neighbors_count\u0026quot; ) This can be done as well with the pdp package, that uses a slightly different algorithm to plot interaction surfaces.\npdp::partial( model.non.spatial, train = plant_richness_df, pred.var = c(\u0026quot;climate_bio1_average\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;neighbors_count\u0026quot;), plot = TRUE ) Model performance The performance slot (in model.non.spatial$performance) contains the values of several performance measures. It be printed via the function print_performance().\nspatialRF::print_performance(model.non.spatial) ## ## Model performance ## - R squared (oob): 0.6075314 ## - R squared (cor(obs, pred)^2): 0.9543769 ## - Pseudo R squared (cor(obs, pred)):0.9769221 ## - RMSE (oob): 2111.241 ## - RMSE: 902.1424 ## - Normalized RMSE: 0.2604337 R squared (oob) and RMSE (oob) are the R squared of the model and its root mean squared error when predicting the out-of-bag data (fraction of data not used to train individual trees). From all the values available in the performance slot, probably these the most honest ones, as it is the closer trying to get a performance estimate on independent data. However, out-of-bag data is not fully independent, and therefore will still be inflated, especially if the data is highly aggregated in space. R squared and pseudo R squared are computed from the observations and the predictions, and indicate to what extent model outcomes represent the input data. These values will usually be high the data is highly aggregated in space. The RMSE and its normalized version are computed via root_mean_squared_error(), and are linear with R squared and pseudo R squared. Spatial cross-validation The function rf_evaluate() overcomes the limitations of the performance scores explained above by providing honest performance based on spatial cross-validation. The function separates the data into a number of spatially independent training and testing folds. Then, it fits a model on each training fold, predicts over each testing fold, and computes statistics of performance measures across folds.

To reduce the spatial autocorrelation of the residuals as much as possible, the non-spatial model can be transformed into a *spatial model* very easily with the function [`rf_spatial()`](https://blasbenito.github.io/spatialRF/reference/rf_spatial.html).

They represent the effect of spatial proximity among records, helping to represent biogeographic and spatial processes not considered by the non-spatial predictors.\nspatial.predictors \u0026lt;- spatialRF::get_spatial_predictors(model.spatial) pr \u0026lt;- data.frame(spatial.predictors, plant_richness_df[, c(\u0026quot;x\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;y\u0026quot;)]) p1 \u0026lt;- ggplot2::ggplot() + ggplot2::geom_sf(data = world, fill = \u0026quot;white\u0026quot;) + ggplot2::geom_point( data = pr, ggplot2::aes( x = x, y = y, color = spatial_predictor_0_2 ), size = 2.5 ) + ggplot2::scale_color_viridis_c(option = \u0026quot;F\u0026quot;) + ggplot2::theme_bw() + ggplot2::labs(color = \u0026quot;Eigenvalue\u0026quot;) + ggplot2::scale_x_continuous(limits = c(-170, -30)) + ggplot2::scale_y_continuous(limits = c(-58, 80)) + ggplot2::ggtitle(\u0026quot;Variable: spatial_predictor_0_2\u0026quot;) + ggplot2::theme(legend.position = \u0026quot;bottom\u0026quot;)+ ggplot2::xlab(\u0026quot;Longitude\u0026quot;) + ggplot2::ylab(\u0026quot;Latitude\u0026quot;) p2 \u0026lt;- ggplot2::ggplot() + ggplot2::geom_sf(data = world, fill = \u0026quot;white\u0026quot;) + ggplot2::geom_point( data = pr, ggplot2::aes( x = x, y = y, color = spatial_predictor_0_5, ), size = 2.5 ) + ggplot2::scale_color_viridis_c(option = \u0026quot;F\u0026quot;) + ggplot2::theme_bw() + ggplot2::labs(color = \u0026quot;Eigenvalue\u0026quot;) + ggplot2::scale_x_continuous(limits = c(-170, -30)) + ggplot2::scale_y_continuous(limits = c(-58, 80)) + ggplot2::ggtitle(\u0026quot;Variable: spatial_predictor_0_5\u0026quot;) + ggplot2::theme(legend.position = \u0026quot;bottom\u0026quot;) + ggplot2::xlab(\u0026quot;Longitude\u0026quot;) + ggplot2::ylab(\u0026quot;\u0026quot;) p1 | p2 The spatial predictors are included in the model one by one, in the order of their Moran\u0026rsquo;s I (spatial predictors with Moran\u0026rsquo;s I lower than 0 are removed). The selection procedure is performed by the function select_spatial_predictors_sequential(), which finds the smaller subset of spatial predictors maximizing the model\u0026rsquo;s R squared, and minimizing the Moran\u0026rsquo;s I of the residuals. This is shown in the optimization plot below (dots linked by lines represent the selected spatial predictors).\np \u0026lt;- spatialRF::plot_optimization(model.spatial) Tuning Random Forest hyperparameters The model fitted above was based on the default random forest hyperparameters of ranger(), and those might not be the most adequate ones for a given dataset. The function rf_tuning() helps the user to choose sensible values for three Random Forest hyperparameters that are critical to model performance:\nnum.trees: number of regression trees in the forest. mtry: number of variables to choose from on each tree split. min.node.size: minimum number of cases on a terminal node. These values can be modified in any model fitted with the package using the ranger.arguments argument. The example below shows how to fit a spatial model with a given set of hyperparameters.\nmodel.spatial \u0026lt;- spatialRF::rf_spatial( model = model.non.spatial, method = \u0026quot;mem.moran.sequential\u0026quot;, #default method ranger.arguments = list( mtry = 5, min.node.size = 20, num.trees = 1000 ), verbose = FALSE, seed = random.seed ) The usual method for model tuning relies on a grid search exploring the results of all the combinations of hyperparameters selected by the user. In spatialRF, model tuning is done via spatial cross-validation, to ensure that the selected combination of hyperparameters maximizes the ability of the model to predict over data not used to train it. Warning: model tuning consumes a lot of computational resources, using it on large datasets might freeze your computer.\nWARNING: model tunning is very RAM-hungry, but you can control RAM usage by defining a lower value for the argument n.cores.\nmodel.spatial \u0026lt;- rf_tuning( model = model.spatial, xy = xy, repetitions = 30, num.trees = c(500, 1000), mtry = seq( 2, length(model.spatial$ranger.arguments$predictor.variable.names), #number of predictors by = 9), min.node.size = c(5, 15), seed = random.seed, verbose = FALSE ) The function returns a tuned model only if the tuning finds a solution better than the original model. Otherwise the original model is returned. The results of the tuning are stored in the model under the name \u0026ldquo;tuning\u0026rdquo;.\nRepeating a model execution Random Forest is an stochastic algorithm that yields slightly different results on each run unless a random seed is set. This particularity has implications for the interpretation of variable importance scores and response curves. The function rf_repeat() repeats a model execution and yields the distribution of importance scores of the predictors across executions. NOTE: this function works better when used at the end of a workflow\nmodel.spatial.repeat \u0026lt;- spatialRF::rf_repeat( model = model.spatial, repetitions = 30, seed = random.seed, verbose = FALSE ) The importance scores of a model fitted with rf_repeat() are plotted as a violin plot, with the distribution of the importance scores of each predictor across repetitions.\nspatialRF::plot_importance( model.spatial.repeat, verbose = FALSE ) The response curves of models fitted with rf_repeat() can be plotted with plot_response_curves() as well. The median prediction is shown with a thicker line.\nspatialRF::plot_response_curves( model.spatial.repeat, quantiles = 0.5, ncol = 3 ) The function print_performance() generates a summary of the performance scores across model repetitions. As every other function of the package involving repetitions, the provided stats are the median, and the median absolute deviation (mad).\nspatialRF::print_performance(model.spatial.repeat) ## ## Model performance (median +/- mad) ## - R squared (oob): 0.593 +/- 0.0098 ## - R squared (cor(obs, pred)^2): 0.957 +/- 0.0016 ## - Pseudo R squared: 0.978 +/- 8e-04 ## - RMSE (oob): 2151.154 +/- 25.7818 ## - RMSE: 914.973 +/- 15.5809 ## - Normalized RMSE: 0.264 +/- 0.0045 Taking advantage of the %\u0026gt;% pipe The modeling functions of spatialRF are designed to facilitate using the pipe to combine them. The code below fits a spatial model, tunes its hyperparameters, evaluates it using spatial cross-validation, and repeats the execution several times, just by passing the model from one function to another.

Let\u0026rsquo;s work on a quick example by turning the response variable of the previous models into a binomial one.\nplant_richness_df$response_binomial \u0026lt;- ifelse( plant_richness_df$richness_species_vascular \u0026gt; 5000, 1, 0 ) The new response variable, response_binomial, will have ones where richness_species_vascular \u0026gt; 5000, and zeros otherwise. This would be equivalent to having the classes \u0026ldquo;high richness\u0026rdquo; (represented by the ones) and \u0026ldquo;low richness\u0026rdquo;, represented by the zeros. The binomial regression model would then have as objective to compute the probability of each ecoregion to belong to the \u0026ldquo;high richness\u0026rdquo; class.\nThere is something important to notice before moving forward though. The number of zeros in the new response variable is larger than the number of ones.\ntable(plant_richness_df$response_binomial) ## ## 0 1 ## 165 62 This means that there is class imbalance, and under this scenario, any random forest model is going to get better at predicting the most abundant class, while in our case the \u0026ldquo;target\u0026rdquo; is the less abundant one. But the function rf() is ready to deal with this issue. Let\u0026rsquo;s fit a model to see what am I talking about.\nmodel.non.spatial \u0026lt;- spatialRF::rf( data = plant_richness_df, dependent.variable.name = \u0026quot;response_binomial\u0026quot;, predictor.variable.names = predictor.variable.names, distance.matrix = distance.matrix, distance.thresholds = distance.thresholds, seed = random.seed, verbose = FALSE ) The function detects that the response variable is binary (using the function is_binary()), and computes case weights for the ones and the zeros. These case weights are stored in the ranger.arguments slot of the model, and are used to give preference to the cases with larger weights during the selection of the out-of-bag data (check the case.weights argument in ranger::ranger()). As a result, each individual tree in the forest is trained with a similar proportion of zeros and ones, which helps mitigate the class imbalance issue. This method is named weighted Random Forest, and is very well explained in this white paper that includes the father of Random Forest, Leo Breiman, as coauthor.\nunique(model.non.spatial$ranger.arguments$case.weights) ## [1] 0.006060606 0.016129032 This model could be projected right away onto a raster stack with maps of the predictors, so, in fact, spatialRF can be used to fit Species Distribution Models, when it actually wasn\u0026rsquo;t really designed with such a purpose in mind. And as an additional advantage, the model can be evaluated with rf_evaluate(), which is way better than cross-validation via random data-splitting ( this blog post explains explains why).\nmodel.non.spatial \u0026lt;- spatialRF::rf_evaluate( model.non.spatial, xy = xy, metrics = \u0026quot;auc\u0026quot;, verbose = FALSE ) spatialRF::print_evaluation(model.non.spatial) ## ## Spatial evaluation ## - Training fraction: 0.75 ## - Spatial folds: 29 ## ## Metric Median MAD Minimum Maximum ## auc 0.932 0.024 0.83 0.977 The take away message here is that you can work with a binomial response with spatialRF, just as you would do with a continuous response, as long as it is represented with zeros and ones. Just remember that the class imbalance problem is tackled via case weights, and that predictive performance is also measured using the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC).\nGenerating spatial predictors for other modelling methods You might not love Random Forest, but spatialRF loves you, and as such, it gives you tools to generate spatial predictors for other models anyway.\nThe first step requires generating Moran\u0026rsquo;s Eigenvector Maps (MEMs) from the distance matrix. Here there are two options, computing MEMs for a single neighborhood distance with mem(), and computing MEMs for several neighborhood distances at once with mem_multithreshold().\n#single distance (0km by default) mems \u0026lt;- spatialRF::mem(distance.matrix = distance_matrix) #several distances mems \u0026lt;- spatialRF::mem_multithreshold( distance.matrix = distance.matrix, distance.thresholds = distance.thresholds ) In either case the result is a data frame with Moran\u0026rsquo;s Eigenvector Maps (\u0026ldquo;just\u0026rdquo; the positive eigenvectors of the double-centered distance matrix).\nkableExtra::kbl( head(mems[, 1:4], n = 10), format = \u0026quot;html\u0026quot; ) %\u0026gt;% kableExtra::kable_paper(\u0026quot;hover\u0026quot;, full_width = F) spatial_predictor_0_1 spatial_predictor_0_2 spatial_predictor_0_3 spatial_predictor_0_4 -0.0259217 0.0052203 -0.0416969 -0.0363324 -0.0996679 0.0539713 -0.1324480 0.3826928 -0.0010477 -0.0143046 0.0443602 -0.0031386 -0.0165695 0.0047991 -0.0307457 0.0005170 -0.0225761 0.0019595 -0.0230368 -0.0524239 -0.0155252 0.0023742 -0.0197953 -0.0338956 -0.0229197 0.0039860 -0.0312561 -0.0416697 0.2436009 -0.1155295 -0.0791452 0.0189996 -0.0150725 -0.0158684 0.1010284 0.0095590 0.1187381 -0.0471879 -0.0359881 0.0065211 But not all MEMs are made equal, and you will need to rank them by their Moran\u0026rsquo;s I.

Across species studied, HSI has either been presented as a poor predictor of abundance or as a predictor of potential rather than realized abundance. The main explanation of the lack of relationship between HSI and abundance is that the local abundance of a species varies in time due to various ecological processes that are not integrated into correlative SDM. To better understand the HSI-abundance relationship, in addition to the study of the association between HSI and mean abundance, we explored its variation over time. We used data from 10-years monitoring of a Houbara bustard (Chlamydotis undulata undulata) population in Morocco. From various occurrence data we modelled the HSI. From (independent) count data we calculated four local abundance indices: mean abundance, maximum abundance, the temporal trend of abundance and the coefficient of variation of abundance over the study period. We explored the relationship between HSI and abundance indices using linear, polynomial and quantile regressions. We found a triangular relationship between local abundance (mean and maximum) and HSI, indicating that the upper limit of mean and maximum abundance increased with HSI. Our results also indicate that sites with the highest HSI were associated with least variation in local abundance, the highest variation being observed at intermediate HSI. Our results provide new empirical evidence supporting the generalization of the triangular relationship between HSI and abundance. Overall, our results support the hypothesis that HSI obtained from SDMs can reflect the local abundance potentialities of a species and emphasize the importance of investigating this relationship using temporal variation in abundance.","tags":["Population Dynamics","Quantile Regression","Habitat Suitability","Species Distribution Models","Random Forest","spatialRF"],"title":"Species Distribution Models predict abundance and its temporal variation in a steppe bird population.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Laura MartÃ­n GarcÃ­a","Nereida M.

Understanding how aquatic ecosystems will respond to anthropogenic stressors and accelerated warming requires shifting from short-term and static to long-term, dynamic characterizations of human-terrestrial-aquatic relationships. Here we use sediment records from Lake Llaviucu, a tropical mountain Andean lake long accessed by Indigenous and post-European societies, and hypothesize that under natural historical conditions (i.e., low human pressure) vegetation and aquatic ecosystems' responses to change are coupled through indirect climate influencesâthat is, past climate-driven vegetation changes dictated limnological trajectories. We used a multi-proxy paleoecological approach including drivers of terrestrial vegetation change (pollen), soil erosion (Titanium), human activity (agropastoralism indicators), and aquatic responses (diatoms) to estimate assemblage-wide rates of change and model their synchronous and asynchronous (lagged) relationships using Generalized Additive Models. Assemblage-wide rate of change results showed that between ca. 3000 and 400 calibrated years before present (cal years BP) terrestrial vegetation, agropastoralism and diatoms fluctuated along their mean regimes of rate of change without consistent periods of synchronous rapid change. In contrast, positive lagged relationships (i.e., asynchrony) between climate-driven terrestrial pollen changes and diatom responses (i.e., asynchrony) were in operation until ca. 750 cal years BP. Thereafter, positive lagged relationships between agropastoralism and diatom rates of changes dictated the lake trajectory, reflecting the primary control of human practices over the aquatic ecosystem prior European occupation. We interpret that shifts in Indigenous practices (e.g., valley terracing) curtailed nutrient inputs into the lake decoupling the links between climate-driven vegetation changes and the aquatic community. Our results demonstrate how rates of change of anthropogenic and climatic influences can guide dynamic ecological baselines for managing water ecosystem services in the Andes.","tags":["Time-series analysis","Palaeoecology","Generalized Additive Models"],"title":"Human practices behind the aquatic and terrestrial ecological decoupling to climate change in the tropical Andes.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alice Monnier-Corbel","Anne-Christine Monnet","LÃ©o Bacon","Blas M.

Here, we explore the presence of density-dependent processes in a reinforced population of North African Houbara bustard (Chlamydotis undulata undulata). We investigated the relationship between reproductive success and local density, and the possible variation of this relationship according to habitat suitability using three independent datasets. Based on eight years of nests monitoring (more than 7000 nests), we modeled the Daily Nest Survival Rate (DNSR) as a proxy of reproductive success. Our results indicate that DNSR was negatively impacted by local densities and that this relationship was approximately constant in space and time: (1) although DNSR strongly decreased over the breeding season, the negative relationship between DNSR and density remained constant over the breeding season; (2) this density-dependent relationship did not vary with the quality of the habitat associated with the nest location. Previous studies have shown that the demographic parameters and population dynamics of the reinforced North African Houbara bustard are strongly influenced by extrinsic environmental and management parameters. Our study further indicates the existence of density-dependent regulation in a low-density, managed population.","tags":["Population Ecology","Population Density","Random Forest","spatialRF","Biogeography","Conservation","Species Distribution Models"],"title":"Density-dependence of reproductive success in a Houbara bustard population.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["JoaquÃ­n Moreno","Sergio Asensio","Miguel Berdugo","Beatriz Gozalo","Victoria Ochoa","David S.

If you are an advanced R user, this post will likely waste your time. We ecologists like to measure all things in nature, and compositional changes in biological communities over time or space, a.k.a betadiversity, is one of these things. I am not going to explain what betadiversity is because others that know better than me have done it already. Good examples are this post published the blog of Methods in Ecology and Evolution by Andres Baselga, and this lecture by Tim Seipel.\nWhat I am actually going to do in this post is to explain how to write functions to compute betadiversity indices in R from species lists rather than from presence-absence matrices. For the latter there are a few packages such as vegan, BAT, MBI, or betapart, but for the former I was unable to find anything suitable. To make this post useful for R beginners, I will go step by step on the rationale behind the design of the functions to compute betadiversity indices, and by the end of the post I will explain how to organize them to achieve a clean R workflow.\nLetâs go!\nBetadiversity indices There are a few betadiversity indices out there, and I totally recommend you to start with Koleff et al. (2003) as a primer. They review the literature and analyze the properties of 24 different indices to provide guidance on how to use them.\nBetadiversity components a, b, and c Betadiversity indices are designed to compare the taxa pools of two sites at a time, and require the computation of three components:\na: number of common taxa of both sites. b: number of exclusive taxa of one site. c: number of exclusive taxa of the other site. Letâs see how can we use these diversity components to compute betadiversity indices.\nSÃ¸rensenâs Beta Letâs start with the SÃ¸rensenâs Beta (\\(\\beta_{sor}\\) hereafter), as presented in Koleff et al. (2003).\n\\[\\beta_{sor} = \\frac{2a}{2a + b + c}\\]\n\\(\\beta_{sor}\\) is a similarity index in the range [0, 1] (the closer to one, the more similar the taxa pools of both sites are) that puts a lot of weight in the \\(a\\) component, and is therefore a measure of continuity, as it focuses the most in the common taxa among sites.\nSimpsonâs Beta Another popular betadiversity index is the Simpsonâs Beta (\\(\\beta_{sim}\\) hereafter).\n\\[\\beta_{sim} = \\frac{min(b, c)}{min(b, c) + a}\\] where \\(min()\\) is a function that takes the minimum value among the diversity components within the parenthesis. \\(\\beta_{sim}\\) is a dissimilarity measure that focuses on compositional turnover among sites because it focuses the most on the values of \\(b\\) and \\(c\\). It has its lower bound in zero, and an open upper value.\nTo bring these ideas into R, first we have to load a few R packages, and generate some fake data to help us develop the functions.\nlibrary(magrittr) library(foreach) library(doParallel) ## Loading required package: iterators ## Loading required package: parallel The code chunk below generates 15 fake taxa names, from taxon_1 to taxon_15.\ntaxa \u0026lt;- paste0(\u0026quot;taxon_\u0026quot;, 1:15) With these fake taxa we are going to generate taxa lists for four hypothetical sites named site1, site2, site3, and site4. Two of the sites will have identical taxa lists, two will have non-overlapping taxa lists, and two of them will have some overlap.\nsite1 \u0026lt;- site2 \u0026lt;- taxa[1:7] site3 \u0026lt;- taxa[8:12] site4 \u0026lt;- taxa[10:15] So now we have these taxa lists:\nsite1 #and site2 ## [1] \u0026quot;taxon_1\u0026quot; \u0026quot;taxon_2\u0026quot; \u0026quot;taxon_3\u0026quot; \u0026quot;taxon_4\u0026quot; \u0026quot;taxon_5\u0026quot; \u0026quot;taxon_6\u0026quot; \u0026quot;taxon_7\u0026quot; site3 ## [1] \u0026quot;taxon_8\u0026quot; \u0026quot;taxon_9\u0026quot; \u0026quot;taxon_10\u0026quot; \u0026quot;taxon_11\u0026quot; \u0026quot;taxon_12\u0026quot; site4 ## [1] \u0026quot;taxon_10\u0026quot; \u0026quot;taxon_11\u0026quot; \u0026quot;taxon_12\u0026quot; \u0026quot;taxon_13\u0026quot; \u0026quot;taxon_14\u0026quot; \u0026quot;taxon_15\u0026quot; Step-by-step computation of betadiversity indices with R For a given pair of sites, how can we compute the diversity components a, b, and c?\nLooking at it from an R perspective, each site is a character vector, so a can be found by counting the number of common elements between two vectors. These common elements can be found with the function intersect(), and the number of elements can be computed by applying length() on the result of intersect().\na \u0026lt;- length(intersect(site3, site4)) a ## [1] 3 To compute b and c we can use the function setdiff(), that finds the exclusive elements of one character vector when comparing it with another. In this case, b is computed for the first vector introduced in the function, site3 in this caseâ¦\nb \u0026lt;- length(setdiff(site3, site4)) b ## [1] 2 â¦ so to compute the c component we only need to switch the sites.\nc \u0026lt;- length(setdiff(site4, site3)) c ## [1] 3 Now that we know a, b, and c, we can compute \\(\\beta_{sor}\\) and \\(\\beta_{sim}\\).\nBsor \u0026lt;- 2 * a / (2 * a + b + c) Bsor ## [1] 0.5454545 Bsim\u0026lt;- min(b, c) / (min(b, c) + a) Bsim ## [1] 0.4 Of course, if we have a long list of sites, computing betadiversity indices like this can get quite boring quite fast. Letâs put everything in a set of functions to make it easier to work with.\nWriting functions to compute betadiversity indices The basic structure of a function definition in R looks as follows:\nfunction_name \u0026lt;- function(x, y, ...){ output \u0026lt;- [body] output #also return(output) } Where:\nfunction_name is the name of your function. Ideally, a verb, or otherwise, something indicating somehow what the function will do with the input data and arguments. function() is a function to define functions, there isnât much more to itâ¦ x is the first argument of the function, and ideally, represents the input data. If that is the case, you can later use pipes (%\u0026gt;%) to chain functions together. y (it could have any other name) is another function argument, an can be either another input dataset, or an argument defining how the function has to behave. ... refers to other arguments the function may require. body is the code that operates with the data and function arguments. This can be one line of code, or a thousand, it all comes down to the functionâs objective. In any case, the body must return an object (or an error if something went wrong) that will be the functionâs output. output is the object ultimately produced by the function. It can have any name, and can be any kind of structure, such a number, a vector, a data frame, a list, etc. R functions return one output object only. Since R functions return the last evaluated value, it is good practice to put the output object at the end of the function as an explicit way to state what the actual output of the function is. Letâs start writing a function to compute a, b, and c from a pair of sites.\n#x: taxa list of one site #y: taxa list of another site abc \u0026lt;- function(x, y){ #list to store output out \u0026lt;- list() #filling the list out$a \u0026lt;- length(intersect(x, y)) out$b \u0026lt;- length(setdiff(x, y)) out$c \u0026lt;- length(setdiff(y, x)) #returning the output out } Notice that to to return the three values I am wrapping them in a list. Letâs run a little test.\nx \u0026lt;- abc( x = site3, y = site4 ) x ## $a ## [1] 3 ## ## $b ## [1] 2 ## ## $c ## [1] 3 So far so good! From here we build the functions sorensen_beta() and simpson_beta() making sure they can accept the output of abc(), and return it with an added slot.\nsorensen_beta \u0026lt;- function(x){ x$bsor \u0026lt;- round(2 * x$a / (2 * x$a + x$b + x$c), 3) x } simpson_beta \u0026lt;- function(x){ x$bsim \u0026lt;- round(min(x$b, x$c) / (min(x$b, x$c) + x$a), 3) x } Notice that both functions are returning the input x with an added slot named after the given betadiversity index. Letâs test them first, to later see why returning the input object gives these functions a lot of flexibility.\nsorensen_beta(x) ## $a ## [1] 3 ## ## $b ## [1] 2 ## ## $c ## [1] 3 ## ## $bsor ## [1] 0.545 simpson_beta(x) ## $a ## [1] 3 ## ## $b ## [1] 2 ## ## $c ## [1] 3 ## ## $bsim ## [1] 0.4 When I said that returning the input object with an added slot gave these functions a lot of flexibility I was talking about this:\nx \u0026lt;- abc( x = site3, y = site4 ) %\u0026gt;% sorensen_beta() %\u0026gt;% simpson_beta() x ## $a ## [1] 3 ## ## $b ## [1] 2 ## ## $c ## [1] 3 ## ## $bsor ## [1] 0.545 ## ## $bsim ## [1] 0.4 Chaining the functions through the %\u0026gt;% pipe of the magrittr package now allows us to combine their results in a single output no matter whether we use sorensen_beta() or sorensen_beta() first, or whether we omit one of them. The only thing the pipe is doing here is moving the output of the first function into the next. There are a couple of very nice tutorials about the magrittr package and the %\u0026gt;% here and here.\nWe can put that idea right away into a function to compute both betadiversity indices at once from the taxa list of a pair of sites.\nbetadiversity \u0026lt;- function(x, y){ require(magrittr) abc(x, y) %\u0026gt;% sorensen_beta() %\u0026gt;% simpson_beta() } The function now works as follows.\nx \u0026lt;- betadiversity( x = site3, y = site4 ) x ## $a ## [1] 3 ## ## $b ## [1] 2 ## ## $c ## [1] 3 ## ## $bsor ## [1] 0.545 ## ## $bsim ## [1] 0.4 So far we have four functionsâ¦\nabc() simpson_beta(), that requires abc(). sorensen_beta(), that requires abc(). betadiversity(), that requires abc(), simpson_beta(), and sorensen_beta(). â¦ and one limitation: so far we can only return betadiversity indices for two sites at a time. So at the moment, to compute betadiversity indices for all combinations of sites we have to do a pretty ridiculous thing:\nx1 \u0026lt;- betadiversity(x = site1, y = site2) x2 \u0026lt;- betadiversity(x = site1, y = site3) x3 \u0026lt;- betadiversity(x = site1, y = site4) #... and so on If I see you doing this Iâll come to haunt you in your nightmares! Since a real analysis may involve hundreds of sites, the next step is to use the functions above to build a new one able to intake an arbitrary number of sites.\nWriting a function to compute betadiversity indices for an arbitrary number of sites. First we have to organize our sites in a data frame with a long format.\nsites \u0026lt;- data.frame( site = c( rep(\u0026quot;site1\u0026quot;, length(site1)), rep(\u0026quot;site2\u0026quot;, length(site2)), rep(\u0026quot;site3\u0026quot;, length(site3)), rep(\u0026quot;site4\u0026quot;, length(site4)) ), taxon = c( site1, site2, site3, site4 ) ) site taxon site1 taxon_1 site1 taxon_2 site1 taxon_3 site1 taxon_4 site1 taxon_5 site1 taxon_6 site1 taxon_7 site2 taxon_1 site2 taxon_2 site2 taxon_3 site2 taxon_4 site2 taxon_5 site2 taxon_6 site2 taxon_7 site3 taxon_8 site3 taxon_9 site3 taxon_10 site3 taxon_11 site3 taxon_12 site4 taxon_10 site4 taxon_11 site4 taxon_12 site4 taxon_13 site4 taxon_14 site4 taxon_15 Our new function will need to do several things:\nGenerate combinations of the unique values of the column site two by two without repetition. Iterate through these combinations of two sites to compute betadiversity components and indices. Return a dataframe with the results to facilitate further analyses. The combinations of site pairs are done with utils::combn() as follows:\nsite.combinations \u0026lt;- utils::combn( x = unique(sites$site), m = 2 ) site.combinations ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] ## [1,] \u0026quot;site1\u0026quot; \u0026quot;site1\u0026quot; \u0026quot;site1\u0026quot; \u0026quot;site2\u0026quot; \u0026quot;site2\u0026quot; \u0026quot;site3\u0026quot; ## [2,] \u0026quot;site2\u0026quot; \u0026quot;site3\u0026quot; \u0026quot;site4\u0026quot; \u0026quot;site3\u0026quot; \u0026quot;site4\u0026quot; \u0026quot;site4\u0026quot; The result is a matrix, and each pair of rows in a column contain a pair of sites. The idea now is to iterate over the matrix columns, obtain the set of taxa from each site from the taxon column of the sites data frame, and use these taxa lists to compute the betadiversity components and indices.\nTo easily generate the output data frame, I use the foreach::foreach() function to iterate through pairs instead of a more traditional for loop. You can read more about foreach() in a previous post.\nbetadiversity.df \u0026lt;- foreach::foreach( i = 1:ncol(site.combinations), #iterates through columns of site.combinations .combine = \u0026#39;rbind\u0026#39; #to produce a data frame ) %do% { #site names site.one \u0026lt;- site.combinations[1, i] #from column i, row 1 site.two \u0026lt;- site.combinations[2, i] #from column i, row 2 #getting taxa lists taxa.list.one \u0026lt;- sites[sites$site %in% site.one, \u0026quot;taxon\u0026quot;] taxa.list.two \u0026lt;- sites[sites$site %in% site.two, \u0026quot;taxon\u0026quot;] #betadiversity beta \u0026lt;- betadiversity( x = taxa.list.one, y = taxa.list.two ) #adding site names beta$site.one \u0026lt;- site.one beta$site.two \u0026lt;- site.two #returning output beta } a b c bsor bsim site.one site.two 7 0 0 1 0 site1 site2 0 7 5 0 1 site1 site3 0 7 6 0 1 site1 site4 0 7 5 0 1 site2 site3 0 7 6 0 1 site2 site4 3 2 3 0.545 0.4 site3 site4 Now that we know it works, we can put everything together in a function. Notice that to make the function more general, I have added arguments requesting the names of the columns with the site and the taxa names.\nbetadiversity_multisite \u0026lt;- function( x, site.column, #column with site names taxa.column #column with taxa names ){ #get site combinations site.combinations \u0026lt;- utils::combn( x = unique(x[, site.column]), m = 2 ) #iterating through site pairs betadiversity.df \u0026lt;- foreach::foreach( i = 1:ncol(site.combinations), .combine = \u0026#39;rbind\u0026#39; ) %do% { #site names site.one \u0026lt;- site.combinations[1, i] site.two \u0026lt;- site.combinations[2, i] #getting taxa lists taxa.list.one \u0026lt;- x[x[, site.column] %in% site.one, taxa.column] taxa.list.two \u0026lt;- x[x[, site.column] %in% site.two, taxa.column] #betadiversity beta \u0026lt;- betadiversity( x = taxa.list.one, y = taxa.list.two ) #adding site names beta$site.one \u0026lt;- site.one beta$site.two \u0026lt;- site.two #returning output beta } #remove bad rownames rownames(betadiversity.df) \u0026lt;- NULL #reordering columns betadiversity.df \u0026lt;- betadiversity.df[, c( \u0026quot;site.one\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;site.two\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;a\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;b\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;c\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;bsor\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;bsim\u0026quot; )] #returning output return(betadiversity.df) } And the test!\nsites.betadiversity \u0026lt;- betadiversity_multisite( x = sites, site.column = \u0026quot;site\u0026quot;, taxa.column = \u0026quot;taxon\u0026quot; ) site.one site.two a b c bsor bsim site1 site2 7 0 0 1 0 site1 site3 0 7 5 0 1 site1 site4 0 7 6 0 1 site2 site3 0 7 5 0 1 site2 site4 0 7 6 0 1 site3 site4 3 2 3 0.545 0.4 That went well!\nFinally, to have these functions available in my R session I always put them all in a single file in the same folder where my Rstudio project lives, name it something like functions_betadiversity.R, and source it at the beginning of my script or .Rmd file by running a line like the one below.\nsource(\u0026quot;functions_betadiversity.R\u0026quot;) I have placed the file functions_betadiversity.R in this GitHub Gist in case you want to give it a look.

However, so far I havenât covered how to setup a folder shared among the cluster nodes to store the results of parallel computations.\nThis post (developed on Ubuntu and Ubuntu Server 20.04) assumes that the home cluster runs on Linux, and covers the following topics.\nBasics of the Network File System protocol (NFS). Setup of an NFS folder in a home cluster. Using an NFS folder in a parallelized loop. The Network File System protocol (NFS) The Network File System protocol offers the means for a host computer to allow other computers in the network (clients) to read and write the contents of a given folder. The clients access such folder like if it was a local one, while in fact it is a reference to the one in the host computer.\nThe image at the beginning of the post illustrates the concept. There is a host computer with a folder in the path /home/user/cluster_shared (were user is your user name) that is broadcasted to the network, and there are one or several clients that are mounting mounting (making accessible) the same folder in their local paths /home/user/cluster_shared.\nIf the host writes a file to the shared folder, it is available right away for the clients, and the other way around. At the end, the idea is to have a folder shared among all computers in the cluster, while having the same exact path on each one of them to write or read files from such shared folder.\nSetup of an NFS folder in a home cluster To setup the shared folder weâll need to do some things in the host, and some things in the clients. Letâs start with the host.\nPreparing the host computer First we need to install the nfs-kernel-server.\nsudo apt update sudo apt install nfs-kernel-server Now we can create the shared folder. Remember to replace user with your user name, and cluster_shared with the actual folder name you want to use.\nmkdir /home/user/cluster_shared To broadcast it we need to open the file /etc/exportsâ¦\nsudo gedit /etc/exports â¦ and add the following line\n/home/user/cluster_shared IP_CLIENT1(rw,no_subtree_check) IP_CLIENT2(rw,no_subtree_check) IP_CLIENT3(rw,no_subtree_check) where:\n/home/user/cluster_shared is the path of the shared folder. IP_CLIENTx are the IPs of each one of the clients. rw gives reading and writing permission on the shared folder to the given client. no_subtree_check prevents the host from checking the complete tree of shares before attending a request (read or write) by a client. For example, the last line of my /etc/exports file looks like this:\n/home/blas/cluster_shared 10.42.0.34(rw,async,no_subtree_check) 10.42.0.104(rw,async,no_subtree_check) Save the file, and to make the changes effective, execute:\nsudo exportfs -ra To end preparing the host we have to update the firewall rules to allow nfs connections from the clients.

This section intends to complete that post by showing how a shared NFS folder can be used to store input and output files during the execution of a parallelized loop\nThe task In this hypothetical example we have a large number of data frames stored in /home/user/cluster_shared/input. Each data frame has the same predictors a, b, c, and d, and a different response variable, named y1 for the data frame y1, y2 for the data frame y2, and so on. In the example we will be using 100 data frames, but there could be thousands. This example would be valid as well for any other kind of object, such as raster files, time-series, etc etc.\nFirst we have to load the libraries weâll be using.\n#automatic install of packages if they are not installed already list.of.packages \u0026lt;- c( \u0026quot;foreach\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;doParallel\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ranger\u0026quot; ) new.packages \u0026lt;- list.of.packages[!(list.of.packages %in% installed.packages()[,\u0026quot;Package\u0026quot;])] if(length(new.packages) \u0026gt; 0){ install.packages(new.packages, dep=TRUE) } #loading packages for(package.i in list.of.packages){ suppressPackageStartupMessages( library( package.i, character.only = TRUE ) ) } The code chunk below generates the folder /home/user/cluster_shared/input and populates it with the dummy files.\n#creating the input folder input.folder \u0026lt;- \u0026quot;/home/blas/cluster_shared/input\u0026quot; dir.create(input.folder) #data frame names df.names \u0026lt;- paste0(\u0026quot;y\u0026quot;, 1:100) #filling it with files for(i in df.names){ #creating the df df.i \u0026lt;- data.frame( y = rnorm(1000), a = rnorm(1000), b = rnorm(1000), c = rnorm(1000), d = rnorm(1000) ) #changing name of the response variable colnames(df.i)[1] \u0026lt;- i #assign to a variable with name i assign(i, df.i) #saving the object save( list = i, file = paste0(input.folder, \u0026quot;/\u0026quot;, i, \u0026quot;.RData\u0026quot;) ) #removing the generated data frame form the environment rm(list = i, df.i, i) } Our target now will be to fit one ranger::ranger() model per data frame stored in /home/blas/cluster_shared/input, save the model result to a folder with the path /home/blas/cluster_shared/input, and write a small summary of the model to the output of foreach.\nSuch target is based on this rationale: When executing a foreach loop as in x \u0026lt;- foreach(...) %dopar% {...}, the variable x is going to grow in memory very fast, competing for RAM resources with the worker nodes. Furthermore, since x is being written on the fly, the results would be lost if the computer crashes. When the size of the input and the output of our parallelized operation is larger than memory, we can use an NFS folder to store inputs and outputs, while keeping the RAM memory free for computational tasks only, with the positive side effect of having our outputs already stored should our computer decide to crash.\nAlso, please notice that here I am focusing in a cluster setting, but using a folder to read and write data during a loop paralellized with foreach can indeed be done in a single computer without an NFS folder. Any folder in your system will do the trick as well!\nSo, from here, we are going to prepare the cluster, and execute a parallelized loop fitting one model per data frame that reads the inputs and writes the outputs to the shared folder.\nCluster setup We will also need the function I showed in the previous post to generate the cluster specification from a GitHub Gist.\nsource(\u0026quot;https://gist.githubusercontent.com/BlasBenito/93ee54d3a98d101754aaff0d658dccca/raw/de57b23740ca90bc02fbd0d5cd3551106ff2fb6d/cluster_spec.R\u0026quot;) Below I use the function to create a cluster specification and initiate the cluster with parallel::makeCluster().\n#generate cluster specification spec \u0026lt;- cluster_spec( ips = c(\u0026#39;10.42.0.1\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;10.42.0.34\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;10.42.0.104\u0026#39;), cores = c(7, 4, 4), user = \u0026quot;blas\u0026quot; ) #define parallel port Sys.setenv(R_PARALLEL_PORT = 11000) Sys.getenv(\u0026quot;R_PARALLEL_PORT\u0026quot;) #setting up cluster my.cluster \u0026lt;- parallel::makeCluster( master = \u0026#39;10.42.0.1\u0026#39;, spec = spec, port = Sys.getenv(\u0026quot;R_PARALLEL_PORT\u0026quot;), outfile = \u0026quot;\u0026quot;, homogeneous = TRUE ) #check cluster definition (optional) print(my.cluster) #register cluster doParallel::registerDoParallel(cl = my.cluster) #check number of workers foreach::getDoParWorkers() Parallelized loop For everything to work as intended, we first need to create the output folder.\noutput.folder \u0026lt;- \u0026quot;/home/blas/cluster_shared/output\u0026quot; dir.create(output.folder) And now we are ready to execute the parallelized loop.

Remove the extension .RData from the file name. Weâll later use the result to use assign() on the fitted model to change its name to the same as the input file before saving it. 2. Read the input data frame and store in an object named df. 3. Fit the model with ranger, using the first column of df as respose variable. 4. Change the model name to the name of the input file without extension, resulting from the first step described above. 5. Save the model into the output folder with the extension .RData. 6.

However, so far I havenât covered how to setup a folder shared among the cluster nodes to store the results of parallel computations.\nThis post (developed on Ubuntu and Ubuntu Server 20.04) assumes that the home cluster runs on Linux, and covers the following topics.\nBasics of the Network File System protocol (NFS). Setup of an NFS folder in a home cluster. Using an NFS folder in a parallelized loop. The Network File System protocol (NFS) The Network File System protocol offers the means for a host computer to allow other computers in the network (clients) to read and write the contents of a given folder. The clients access such folder like if it was a local one, while in fact it is a reference to the one in the host computer.\nThe image at the beginning of the post illustrates the concept. There is a host computer with a folder in the path /home/user/cluster_shared (were user is your user name) that is broadcasted to the network, and there are one or several clients that are mounting mounting (making accessible) the same folder in their local paths /home/user/cluster_shared.\nIf the host writes a file to the shared folder, it is available right away for the clients, and the other way around. At the end, the idea is to have a folder shared among all computers in the cluster, while having the same exact path on each one of them to write or read files from such shared folder.\nSetup of an NFS folder in a home cluster To setup the shared folder weâll need to do some things in the host, and some things in the clients. Letâs start with the host.\nPreparing the host computer First we need to install the nfs-kernel-server.\nsudo apt update sudo apt install nfs-kernel-server Now we can create the shared folder. Remember to replace user with your user name, and cluster_shared with the actual folder name you want to use.\nmkdir /home/user/cluster_shared To broadcast it we need to open the file /etc/exportsâ¦\nsudo gedit /etc/exports â¦ and add the following line\n/home/user/cluster_shared IP_CLIENT1(rw,no_subtree_check) IP_CLIENT2(rw,no_subtree_check) IP_CLIENT3(rw,no_subtree_check) where:\n/home/user/cluster_shared is the path of the shared folder. IP_CLIENTx are the IPs of each one of the clients. rw gives reading and writing permission on the shared folder to the given client. no_subtree_check prevents the host from checking the complete tree of shares before attending a request (read or write) by a client. For example, the last line of my /etc/exports file looks like this:\n/home/blas/cluster_shared 10.42.0.34(rw,async,no_subtree_check) 10.42.0.104(rw,async,no_subtree_check) Save the file, and to make the changes effective, execute:\nsudo exportfs -ra To end preparing the host we have to update the firewall rules to allow nfs connections from the clients.

This model is described in the paper in prep. titled Forest - fire interactions in the Central Pyrenees: a data-model comparison for the Lateglacial-Holocene transition, and authored by Graciela Gil-Romera, Blas M. Benito, Juli G. Pausas, PenÃ©lope GonzÃ¡lez-SampÃ©riz, J. Julio. Camarero, Jens-Christian Svenning, and Blas Valero-GarcÃ©s.\nHOW DOES IT WORK Abiotic component The abiotic layer of the model is represented by three main environmental factors:\nTopography derived from a digital elevation model at 200 x 200 meters resolution. Slope (along temperature) is used to impose restrictions to species distributions. Northness (in the range [0, 1]) is used to restrict fire spread. Aspect is used to draw a shaded relief map (at the user\u0026rsquo;s request). Elevation is used to compute a lapse rate map (see below).\nTemperature (average of montly minimum temperatures) time series for the study area computed from palaeoclimatic data at annual resolution provided by the TraCe simulation, a transient model for the global climate evolution of the last 21K years with an annual resolution. The single temperature value of every year is converted into a temperature map (200 x 200 m resolution) using a lapse rate map based on the elevation map. Temperature, along with slope, is used to compute habitat suitability by using a logistic equation. Habitat suitability affects plant growth and survival.\nFire: The charcoal accumulation rate record (CHAR) from El Portalet palaeoenvironmental sequence (Gil-Romera et al., 2014) is used as input to simulate forest fires. A value of this time series is read each year, and a random number in the range [0, 1] is generated. If the random number is lower than the Fire-probability-per-year (FPY) parameter defined by the user, the value from the charcoal time series is multiplied by the parameter Number-ignitions-per-fire-event (NIF) (defined by the user) to compute the number of ignitions for the given year. As many adult tree as ignitions are selected to start spreading fire. Fire spreads to a neighbor patch if there is an adult tree in there, and a random number in the range [0, 1] is higher than the northness value of the patch.\nBiotic component The biotic layer of the model is composed by five tree species. We have introduced the following elements to represent their ecological dynamics:\nTopoclimatic niche, inferred from their present day distributions and high resolution temperature maps (presence data taken from GBIF, temperature maps taken from Worldclim and the Digital Climatic Atlas of the Iberian Peninsula). The ecological niche is represented by a logistic equation (see below). The results of this equation plus the dispersal dynamics of each species defines changes in distribution over time.\nPopulation dynamics, driven by species traits such as dispersal distance, longevity, fecundity, mortality, growth rate, post-fire response to fire, and heliophity (competition for light). The data is based on the literature and/or expert opinion from forest and fire ecologists, and it is used to simulate growth (using logistic equations), competition for light and space, decay due to senescence, and mortality due to climate, fire, or plagues.\nThe model doesn\u0026rsquo;t simulate the entire populations of the target species. Instead, on each 200 x 200 meters patch it simulates the dynamics of an small forest plot (around 10 x 10 meters) where a maximum of one individual per species can exist.\nModel dynamics Let\u0026rsquo;s burn it! Simulating fire-vegetation dynamics at millennial timescales in the central Pyrenees. from blas benito on Vimeo.\nThe life of an individual\nDuring the model setup seeds of every species are created on every patch. From there, every seed will go through the following steps every simulated year:\nIts age increases by one year, and its life-stage is changed to \u0026ldquo;seedling\u0026rdquo;.\nThe minimum average temperature of its patch is updated.\nThe individual computes its habitat suitability using the logistic equation 1 / ( 1 + exp( -(intercept + coefficient * patch-temperature))), where the intercept and the coefficient are user defined. These parameters are hardcoded to save space in the GUI, and have been computed beforehand by using current presence data and temperature maps.\nIf habitat suitability is higher than a random number in the range [0, 1], the habitat is considered suitable (NOTE: this random number is defined for the patch, and it changes every ~10 years following a random walk drawn from a normal distribution with the average set to the previous value, and a standard deviation of 0.001).\nIf it is lower, the habitat is considered unsuitable, and the number of years under unsuitable habitat is increased by 1.\nIf the number of years unders unsuitable habitat becomes higher than seedling-tolerance, the seedling dies, and another seed from the seed bank takes its place. Otherwise it stays alive. Mortality: If a random number in the range [0, 1] is lower than the seedling mortality of the species the plant dies, and it is replaced by a seed from the seed bank. Otherwise it stays alive.\nCompetition and growth:\nIf the patch total biomass of the individuals in the patch equals Max-biomass-per-patch, the individual loses an amount of biomass between 0 and the 20% of its current biomass. This number is randomly selected.\nIf Max-biomass-per-patch has not been reached yet:\nAn interaction term is computed as (1 - (biomass of other individuals in the patch / Max-biomass-per-patch)) * (1 - heliophilia)).\nThe interaction term is introduced in the growth equation max-biomass / (1 + max-biomass * exp(- growth-rate * interaction-term * habitat-suitability * age)) to compute the current biomass of the individual. The lower the interaction term and habitat suitability are, the lower the growth becomes.\nIf a fire reaches the patch and there are adult individuals of other species on it, the plant dies, and it is replaced by a seed (this seed inherites the traits of the parent).\nThese steps continue while the individual is still a seedling, but once it reaches its maturity some steps become slightly different:\nIf a random number in the range [0, 1] is lower than the adults mortality of the species, or the maximum age of the species is reached, the individual is marked for decay. The current biomass of decaying individuals is computed as previous-biomass - years-of-decay. To add the effect of climatic variability to this decreasing function, its result is multiplied by 1 - habitat-suitability x random[0, 10]. If the biomass is higher than zero, pollen productivity is computed as current-biomass x species-pollen-productivity. The individual dies and is replaced by a seed when the biomass is below 1.\nDispersal: If the individual is in suitable habitat, a seed from it is placed in one of the neighboring patches within a radius given by the dispersal distance of the species (which is measured in \u0026ldquo;number of patches\u0026rdquo; and hardcoded) with no individuals of the same species.\nIf the individual starts a fire, or if fire spreads in from neighboring patches, it is marked as \u0026ldquo;burned\u0026rdquo;, spreads fire to its neighbors, dies, and is replaced by a seed. If the individual belongs to an species with post-fire resprouting, the growth-rate of the seed is multiplied by 2 to boost growth after fire.\nSimulating pollen and charcoal deposition\nThe user defines the radius of a catchment area round the core location (10 km by default, that is 50 patches). All patches within this radius define the RSAP (relevant source area of pollen).\nAt the end of every simulated year the pollen productivity of every adult of each species within the RSAP is summed, and this value is used to compose the simulated pollen curves. The same is done with the biomass of the burned individuals to compose the virtual charcoal curve.\nOutput In GUI\nThe simulation GUI shows the following results in real time:\nPlots of the input values:\nMinimum Temperature of the coldest month. Real charcoal data. Simulated pollen curves for the target taxa.\nSimulated charcoal curve.\nMap showing the distribution of every species and the forest fires.\nWritten to disk\nThe simulated pollen counts and charcoal is exported to the path defined by the user as a table in csv format named output_table.csv. It contains one row per simulated year and the following columns:\nage: simulated year. temperature_minimum_average: average minimum winter temperature of the study area. pollen_Psylvestris: pollen sum for Pinus sylvestris. pollen_Puncinata pollen_Bpendula pollen_Cavellana pollen_Qpetraea real_charcoal: real charcoal values from El Portalet core. ignitions: number of fire ignitions. charcoal_sum: biomass sum of all burned individuals. charcoal_Psylvestris: sum of the biomass of burned individuals of Pinus sylvestris. charcoal_Puncinata charcoal_Bpendula charcoal_Cavellana charcoal_Qpetraea Snapshots of the simulation map taken at 1 or 10 years intervals are stored in the output folder is requested by the user. These snapshots are useful to compose a video of the simulation.\nHOW TO USE IT Input files Input files are stored in a folder named \u0026ldquo;data\u0026rdquo;. These are:\nage: text file with no extension and a single column with no header containing age values from -15000 to -5701 fire: text file with no extension and a single column with no header containing actual charcoal counts expresed in the range [0, 1]. There are as many rows as in the age file t_minimum_average: text file with same features as the ones above containing minimum winter temperatures for the study area extracted from the TraCe simualtion. correct_t_minimum_average.asc: Map at 200m resolution containing the minimum winter temperature difference (period 1970-2000) between the TraCe simulation and the Digital Climatic Atlas of the Iberian Peninsula.

Many things can be done with a cluster, and parallelizing loops is one of them. But there is no need of a cluster to parallelize loops and improve the efficiency of your coding!\nI believe that coding parallelized loops is an important asset for anyone working with R. Thatâs why this post covers the following topics:\nBeyond for: building loops with foreach. What is a parallel backend? Setup of a parallel backend for a single computer. Setup for a Beowulf cluster. Practical examples. Tuning of random forest hyperparameters. Confidence intervals of the importance scores of the predictors in random forest models. for loops are fine, butâ¦ Many experienced R users frequently say that nobody should write loops with R because they are tacky or whatever. However, I find loops easy to write, read, and debug, and are therefore my workhorse whenever I need to repeat a task and I donât feel like using apply() and the likes. However, regular for loops in R are highly inefficient, because they only use one of your computer cores to perform the iterations.\nFor example, the for loop below sorts vectors of random numbers a given number of times, and will only work on one of your computer cores for a few seconds, while the others are there, procrastinating with no shame.\nWot Cpu GIF from Wot GIFs (gif kindly suggested by Andreas Angourakis)\nfor(i in 1:10000){ sort(runif(10000)) } If every i could run in a different core, the operation would indeed run a bit faster, and we would get rid of lazy cores. This is were packages like foreach and doParallel come into play. Letâs start installing these packages and a few others that will be useful throughout this tutorial.\n#automatic install of packages if they are not installed already list.of.packages \u0026lt;- c( \u0026quot;foreach\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;doParallel\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ranger\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;palmerpenguins\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;tidyverse\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;kableExtra\u0026quot; ) new.packages \u0026lt;- list.of.packages[!(list.of.packages %in% installed.packages()[,\u0026quot;Package\u0026quot;])] if(length(new.packages) \u0026gt; 0){ install.packages(new.packages, dep=TRUE) } #loading packages for(package.i in list.of.packages){ suppressPackageStartupMessages( library( package.i, character.only = TRUE ) ) } #loading example data data(\u0026quot;penguins\u0026quot;) Beyond for: building loops with foreach The foreach package (the vignette is here) provides a way to build loops that support parallel execution, and easily gather the results provided by each iteration in the loop.\nFor example, this classic for loop computes the square root of the numbers 1 to 5 with sqrt() (the function is vectorized, but letâs conveniently forget that for a moment). Notice that I have to create a vector x to gather the results before executing the loop.\nx \u0026lt;- vector() for(i in 1:10){ x[i] \u0026lt;- sqrt(i) } x ## [1] 1.000000 1.414214 1.732051 2.000000 2.236068 2.449490 2.645751 2.828427 ## [9] 3.000000 3.162278 The foreach version returns a list with the results automatically. Notice that %do% operator after the loop definition, Iâll talk more about it later.\nx \u0026lt;- foreach(i = 1:10) %do% { sqrt(i) } x ## [[1]] ## [1] 1 ## ## [[2]] ## [1] 1.414214 ## ## [[3]] ## [1] 1.732051 ## ## [[4]] ## [1] 2 ## ## [[5]] ## [1] 2.236068 ## ## [[6]] ## [1] 2.44949 ## ## [[7]] ## [1] 2.645751 ## ## [[8]] ## [1] 2.828427 ## ## [[9]] ## [1] 3 ## ## [[10]] ## [1] 3.162278 We can use the .combine argument of foreach to arrange the list as a vector. Other options such as cbind, rbind, or even custom functions can be used as well, only depending on the structure of the output of each iteration.\nx \u0026lt;- foreach( i = 1:10, .combine = \u0026#39;c\u0026#39; ) %do% { sqrt(i) } x ## [1] 1.000000 1.414214 1.732051 2.000000 2.236068 2.449490 2.645751 2.828427 ## [9] 3.000000 3.162278 Another interesting capability of foreach is that it supports several iterators of the same length at once. Notice that the values of the iterators are not combined. When the first value of one iterator is being used, the first value of the other iterators will be used as well.\nx \u0026lt;- foreach( i = 1:3, j = 1:3, k = 1:3, .combine = \u0026#39;c\u0026#39; ) %do% { i + j + k } x ## [1] 3 6 9 Running foreach loops in parallel The foreach loops shown above use the operator %do%, that processes the tasks sequentially. To run tasks in parallel, foreach uses the operator %dopar%, that has to be supported by a parallel backend. If there is no parallel backend, %dopar% warns the user that it is being run sequentially, as shown below. But what the heck is a parallel backend?\nx \u0026lt;- foreach( i = 1:10, .combine = \u0026#39;c\u0026#39; ) %dopar% { sqrt(i) } ## Warning: executing %dopar% sequentially: no parallel backend registered x ## [1] 1.000000 1.414214 1.732051 2.000000 2.236068 2.449490 2.645751 2.828427 ## [9] 3.000000 3.162278 What is a parallel backend? When running tasks in parallel, there should be a director node that tells a group of workers what to do with a given set of data and functions. The workers execute the iterations, and the director manages execution and gathers the results provided by the workers. A parallel backend provides the means for the director and workers to communicate, while allocating and managing the required computing resources (processors, RAM memory, and network bandwidth among others).\nThere are two types of parallel backends that can be used with foreach, FORK and PSOCK.\nFORK FORK backends are only available on UNIX machines (Linux, Mac, and the likes), and do not work in clusters [sad face], so only single-machine environments are appropriate for this backend. In a FORK backend, the workers share the same environment (data, loaded packages, and functions) as the director. This setup is highly efficient because the main environment doesnât have to be copied, and only worker outputs need to be sent back to the director.\nPSOCK PSOCK backends (Parallel Socket Cluster) are available for both UNIX and WINDOWS systems, and are the default option provided with foreach. As their main disadvantage, the environment of the director needs to be copied to the environment of each worker, which increases network overhead while decreasing the overall efficiency of the cluster. By default, all the functions available in base R are copied to each worker, and if a particular set of R packages are needed in the workers, they need to be copied to the respective environments of the workers as well.\nThis post compares both backends and concludes that FORK is about a 40% faster than PSOCK.\nSetup of a parallel backend Here I explain how to setup the parallel backend for a simple computer and for a Beowulf cluster as the one I described in a previous post.\nSetup for a single computer Setting up a cluster in a single computer requires first to find out how many cores we want to use from the ones we have available. It is recommended to leave one free core for other tasks.\nparallel::detectCores() ## [1] 8 n.cores \u0026lt;- parallel::detectCores() - 1 Now we need to define the cluster with parallel::makeCluster() and register it so it can be used by %dopar% with doParallel::registerDoParallel(my.cluster). The type argument of parallel::makeCluster() accepts the strings âPSOCKâ and âFORKâ to define the type of parallel backend to be used.\n#create the cluster my.cluster \u0026lt;- parallel::makeCluster( n.cores, type = \u0026quot;PSOCK\u0026quot; ) #check cluster definition (optional) print(my.cluster) ## socket cluster with 7 nodes on host \u0026#39;localhost\u0026#39; #register it to be used by %dopar% doParallel::registerDoParallel(cl = my.cluster) #check if it is registered (optional) foreach::getDoParRegistered() ## [1] TRUE #how many workers are available? (optional) foreach::getDoParWorkers() ## [1] 7 Now we can run a set of tasks in parallel!\nx \u0026lt;- foreach( i = 1:10, .combine = \u0026#39;c\u0026#39; ) %dopar% { sqrt(i) } x ## [1] 1.000000 1.414214 1.732051 2.000000 2.236068 2.449490 2.645751 2.828427 ## [9] 3.000000 3.162278 If everything went well, now %dopar% should not be throwing the warning executing %dopar% sequentially: no parallel backend registered, meaning that the parallel execution is working as it should. In this little example there is no gain in execution speed, because the operation being executed is extremely fast, but this will change when the operations running inside of the loop take longer times to run.\nFinally, it is always recommendable to stop the cluster when we are done working with it.\nparallel::stopCluster(cl = my.cluster) Setup for a Beowulf cluster This setup is a bit more complex, because it requires to open a port in every computer of the cluster. Ports are virtual communication channels, and are identified by a number.\nFirst, lets tell R what port we want to use:\n#define port Sys.setenv(R_PARALLEL_PORT = 11000) #check that it Sys.getenv(\u0026quot;R_PARALLEL_PORT\u0026quot;) Now, we need to open the selected port in every computer of the network. In Linux we need to setup the firewall to allow connections from the network 10.42.1.0/24 (replace this with your network range if different!) to the port 11000 by splitting the window of the Terminator console in as many computers available in your network (the figure below shows three, one for my PC and two for my Intel NUCs), opening an ssh session on each remote machine, and setting Terminator with Grouping equal to Broadcast all so we only need to type the commands once.\nOpening port 11000 in three computers at once with Terminator\nNow we have to create an object defining the IPs of the computers in the network, the number of cores to use from each computer, the user name, and the identity of the director. This will be the spec argument required by parallel::makeCluster() to create the cluster throughtout the machines in the network. It is a list of lists, with as many lists as nodes are defined. Each sub-list has a slot named host with the IP of the computer where the given node is, and user, with the name of the user in each computer.\nThe code below shows how this would be done, step by step. Yes, this is CUMBERSOME.\n#main parameters director \u0026lt;- \u0026#39;10.42.0.1\u0026#39; nuc2 \u0026lt;- \u0026#39;10.42.0.34\u0026#39; nuc1 \u0026lt;- \u0026#39;10.42.0.104\u0026#39; user \u0026lt;- \u0026quot;blas\u0026quot; #list of machines, user names, and cores spec \u0026lt;- list( list( host = director, user = user, ncore = 7 ), list( host = nuc1, user = user, ncore = 4 ), list( host = nuc2, user = user, ncore = 4 ) ) #generating nodes from the list of machines spec \u0026lt;- lapply( spec, function(spec.i) rep( list( list( host = spec.i$host, user = spec.i$user) ), spec.i$ncore ) ) #formating into a list of lists spec \u0026lt;- unlist( spec, recursive = FALSE ) Generating the spec definition is a bit easier with the function below.\n#function to generate cluster specifications from a vector of IPs, a vector with the number of cores to use on each IP, and a user name cluster_spec \u0026lt;- function( ips, cores, user ){ #creating initial list spec \u0026lt;- list() for(i in 1:length(ips)){ spec[[i]] \u0026lt;- list() spec[[i]]$host \u0026lt;- ips[i] spec[[i]]$user \u0026lt;- user spec[[i]]$ncore \u0026lt;- cores[i] } #generating nodes from the list of machines spec \u0026lt;- lapply( spec, function(spec.i) rep( list( list( host = spec.i$host, user = spec.i$user) ), spec.i$ncore ) ) #formating into a list of lists spec \u0026lt;- unlist( spec, recursive = FALSE ) return(spec) } This function is also available in this GitHub Gist, so you can load it into your R environment by executing:\nsource(\u0026quot;https://gist.githubusercontent.com/BlasBenito/93ee54d3a98d101754aaff0d658dccca/raw/de57b23740ca90bc02fbd0d5cd3551106ff2fb6d/cluster_spec.R\u0026quot;) Below I use it to generate the input to the spec argument to start the cluster with parallel::makeCluster(). Notice that I have added several arguments.\nThe argument outfile determines where the workers write a log. In this case it is set to nowhere with the double quotes, but the path to a text file in the director could be provided here. The argument homogeneous = TRUE indicates that all machines have the Rscript in the same location. In this case all three machines have it at â/usr/lib/R/bin/Rscriptâ.

In the examples I use the penguins data from the palmerpenguins package to fit classification models with random forest using species as a response, and bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, flipper_length_mm, and body_mass_g as predictors.\n#removing NA and subsetting columns penguins \u0026lt;- as.data.frame( na.omit( penguins[, c( \u0026quot;species\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;bill_length_mm\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;bill_depth_mm\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;flipper_length_mm\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;body_mass_g\u0026quot; )] ) ) species bill_length_mm bill_depth_mm flipper_length_mm body_mass_g Adelie 39.1 18.7 181 3750 Adelie 39.5 17.4 186 3800 Adelie 40.3 18.0 195 3250 Adelie 36.7 19.3 193 3450 Adelie 39.3 20.6 190 3650 Adelie 38.9 17.8 181 3625 Adelie 39.2 19.6 195 4675 Adelie 34.1 18.1 193 3475 Adelie 42.0 20.2 190 4250 Adelie 37.8 17.1 186 3300 Adelie 37.8 17.3 180 3700 Adelie 41.1 17.6 182 3200 Adelie 38.6 21.2 191 3800 Adelie 34.6 21.1 198 4400 Adelie 36.6 17.8 185 3700 Adelie 38.7 19.0 195 3450 Adelie 42.5 20.7 197 4500 Adelie 34.4 18.4 184 3325 Adelie 46.0 21.5 194 4200 Adelie 37.8 18.3 174 3400 Weâll fit random forest models with the ranger package, which works as follows:\n#fitting classification model m \u0026lt;- ranger::ranger( data = penguins, dependent.variable.name = \u0026quot;species\u0026quot;, importance = \u0026quot;permutation\u0026quot; ) #summary m ## Ranger result ## ## Call: ## ranger::ranger(data = penguins, dependent.variable.name = \u0026quot;species\u0026quot;, importance = \u0026quot;permutation\u0026quot;) ## ## Type: Classification ## Number of trees: 500 ## Sample size: 342 ## Number of independent variables: 4 ## Mtry: 2 ## Target node size: 1 ## Variable importance mode: permutation ## Splitrule: gini ## OOB prediction error: 2.34 % #variable importance m$variable.importance ## bill_length_mm bill_depth_mm flipper_length_mm body_mass_g ## 0.30464149 0.16554689 0.22329574 0.07775624 The output shows that the percentage of misclassified cases is 2.34, and that bill_length_mm is the variable that contributes the most to the accuracy of the classification.\nIf you are not familiar with random forest, this post and the video below do a pretty good job in explaining the basics:\nTuning random forest hyperparameters Random forest has several hyperparameters that influence model fit:\nnum.trees is the total number of trees to fit. The default value is 500. mtry is the number of variables selected by chance (from the total pool of variables) as candidates for a tree split. The minimum is 2, and the maximum is the total number of predictors. min.node.size is the minimum number of cases that shall go together in the terminal nodes of each tree. For classification models as the ones we are going to fit, 1 is the minimum. Here we are going to explore how combinations of these values increase or decrease the prediction error of the model (percentage of misclassified cases) on the out-of-bag data (not used to train each decision tree). This operation is usually named grid search for hyperparameter optimization.\nTo create these combinations of hyperparameters we use expand.grid().\nsensitivity.df \u0026lt;- expand.grid( num.trees = c(500, 1000, 1500), mtry = 2:4, min.node.size = c(1, 10, 20) ) num.trees mtry min.node.size 500 2 1 1000 2 1 1500 2 1 500 3 1 1000 3 1 1500 3 1 500 4 1 1000 4 1 1500 4 1 500 2 10 1000 2 10 1500 2 10 500 3 10 1000 3 10 1500 3 10 500 4 10 1000 4 10 1500 4 10 500 2 20 1000 2 20 1500 2 20 500 3 20 1000 3 20 1500 3 20 500 4 20 1000 4 20 1500 4 20 Each row in sensitivity.df corresponds to a combination of parameters to test, so there are 27 models to fit. The code below prepares the cluster, and uses the ability of foreach to work with several iterators at once to easily introduce the right set of hyperparameters to each fitted model.\nNotice how in the foreach definition I use the .packages argument to export the ranger package to the environments of the workers.\n#create and register cluster my.cluster \u0026lt;- parallel::makeCluster(n.cores) doParallel::registerDoParallel(cl = my.cluster) #fitting each rf model with different hyperparameters prediction.error \u0026lt;- foreach( num.trees = sensitivity.df$num.trees, mtry = sensitivity.df$mtry, min.node.size = sensitivity.df$min.node.size, .combine = \u0026#39;c\u0026#39;, .packages = \u0026quot;ranger\u0026quot; ) %dopar% { #fit model m.i \u0026lt;- ranger::ranger( data = penguins, dependent.variable.name = \u0026quot;species\u0026quot;, num.trees = num.trees, mtry = mtry, min.node.size = min.node.size ) #returning prediction error as percentage return(m.i$prediction.error * 100) } #adding the prediction error column sensitivity.df$prediction.error \u0026lt;- prediction.error To plot the results:\nggplot2::ggplot(data = sensitivity.df) + ggplot2::aes( x = mtry, y = as.factor(min.node.size), fill = prediction.error ) + ggplot2::facet_wrap(as.factor(num.trees)) + ggplot2::geom_tile() + ggplot2::scale_y_discrete(breaks = c(1, 10, 20)) + ggplot2::scale_fill_viridis_c() + ggplot2::ylab(\u0026quot;min.node.size\u0026quot;) The figure shows that combinations of lower values of min.node.size and mtry generally lead to models with a lower prediction error across different numbers of trees. Retrieving the first line of sensitivity.df ordered by ascending prediction.error will give us the values of the hyperparameters we need to use to reduce the prediction error as much as possible.\nbest.hyperparameters \u0026lt;- sensitivity.df %\u0026gt;% dplyr::arrange(prediction.error) %\u0026gt;% dplyr::slice(1) num.trees mtry min.node.size prediction.error 500 2 1 2.339181 Confidence intervals of variable importance scores Random forest has an important stochastic component during model fitting, and as consequence, the same model will return slightly different results in different runs (unless set.seed() or the seed argument of ranger are used). This variability also affects the importance scores of the predictors, and can be use to our advantage to assess whether the importance scores of different variables do really overlap or not.\nI have written a little function to transform the vector of importance scores returned by ranger into a data frame (of one row). It helps arranging the importance scores of different runs into a long format, which helps a lot to plot a boxplot with ggplot2 right away. This function could have been just some code thrown inside the foreach loop, but I want to illustrate how foreach automatically transfers functions available in the R environment into the environments of the workers when required, without the intervention of the user. The same will happen with the best.hyperparameters tiny data frame we created in the previous section.\nimportance_to_df \u0026lt;- function(model){ x \u0026lt;- as.data.frame(model$variable.importance) x$variable \u0026lt;- rownames(x) colnames(x)[1] \u0026lt;- \u0026quot;importance\u0026quot; rownames(x) \u0026lt;- NULL return(x) } The code chunk below setups the cluster and runs 1000 random forest models in parallel (using the best hyperparameters computed in the previous section) while using system.time() to assess running time.\n#we don\u0026#39;t need to create the cluster, it is still up print(my.cluster) ## socket cluster with 7 nodes on host \u0026#39;localhost\u0026#39; #assessing execution time system.time( #performing 1000 iterations in parallel importance.scores \u0026lt;- foreach( i = 1:1000, .combine = \u0026#39;rbind\u0026#39;, .packages = \u0026quot;ranger\u0026quot; ) %dopar% { #fit model m.i \u0026lt;- ranger::ranger( data = penguins, dependent.variable.name = \u0026quot;species\u0026quot;, importance = \u0026quot;permutation\u0026quot;, mtry = best.hyperparameters$mtry, num.trees = best.hyperparameters$num.trees, min.node.size = best.hyperparameters$min.node.size ) #format importance m.importance.i \u0026lt;- importance_to_df(model = m.i) #returning output return(m.importance.i) } ) ## user system elapsed ## 0.267 0.027 6.556 The output of system.time() goes as follows:\nuser: seconds the R session has been using the CPU. system: seconds the operating system has been using the CPU. elapsed: the total execution time experienced by the user. This will make sense in a minute. In the meantime, letâs plot our results!\nggplot2::ggplot(data = importance.scores) + ggplot2::aes( y = reorder(variable, importance), x = importance ) + ggplot2::geom_boxplot() + ggplot2::ylab(\u0026quot;\u0026quot;) The figure shows that the variable bill_length_mm is the most important in helping the model classifying penguin species, with no overlap with any other variable. In this particular case, since the distributions of the importance scores do not overlap, this analysis isnât truly helpful, but now you know how to do it!\nI assessed the running time with system.time() because ranger() can run in parallel by itself just by setting the num.threads argument to the number of cores available in the machine. This capability cannot be used when executing ranger() inside a parallelized foreach loop though, and it is only useful inside classic for loops.\nWhat option is more efficient then? The code below executes a regular for loop running the function sequentially to evaluate whether it is more efficient to run ranger() in parallel using one core per model, as we did above, or sequentially while using several cores per model on each iteration.\n#list to save results importance.scores.list \u0026lt;- list() #performing 1000 iterations sequentially system.time( for(i in 1:1000){ #fit model m.i \u0026lt;- ranger::ranger( data = penguins, dependent.variable.name = \u0026quot;species\u0026quot;, importance = \u0026quot;permutation\u0026quot;, seed = i, num.threads = parallel::detectCores() - 1 ) #format importance importance.scores.list[[i]] \u0026lt;- importance_to_df(model = m.i) } ) ## user system elapsed ## 43.663 2.815 12.948 As you can see, ranger() takes longer to execute in a regular for loop using several cores at once than in a parallel foreach loop using one core at once. Thatâs a win for the parallelized loop!\nWe can stop our cluster now, we are done with it.\nparallel::stopCluster(cl = my.cluster) A few things to take in mind As I have shown in this post, using parallelized foreach loops can accelerate long computing processes, even when some functions have the ability to run in parallel on their own. However, there are things to take in mind, that might vary depending on whether we are executing the parallelized task on a single computer or on a small cluster.\nIn a single computer, the communication between workers and the director is usually pretty fast, so there are no obvious bottlenecks to take into account here. The only limitation that might arise comes from the availability of RAM memory. For example, if a computer has 8 cores and 8GB of RAM, less than 1GB of RAM will be available for each worker. So, if you need to repeat a process that consumes a significant amount of RAM, the ideal number of cores running in parallel might be lower than the total number of cores available in your system. Donât be greedy, and try to understand the capabilities of your machine while designing a parallelized task.\nWhen running foreach loops as in x \u0026lt;- foreach(...){...}, the variable x is receiving whatever results the workers are producing. For example, if you are only returning the prediction error of a model, or its importance scores, x will have a very manageable size. But if you are returning heavy objects such as complete random forest models, the size of x is going to grow VERY FAST, and at the end it will be competing for RAM resources with the workers, which might even crash your R session. Again, donât be greedy, and size your outputs carefully.\nClusters spanning several computers are a different beast, since the workers and the director communicate through a switch and network wires and interfaces. If the amount of data going to and coming from the workers is large, the network can get clogged easily, reducing the clusterâs efficiency drastically. In general, if the amount of data produced by a worker on each iteration takes longer to arrive to the director than the time it takes the worker to produce it, then a cluster is not going to be more efficient than a single machine. But this is not important if you donât care about efficiency.\nOther issues you might come across while parallelizing tasks in R are thoroughly commented in this post, by Imre Gera.\nThatâs all for now folks, happy parallelization!\n","date":1608940800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1608940800,"objectID":"258c4372b0dc8ca13f2e28fc8d34faa5","permalink":"https://blasbenito.com/post/02_parallelizing_loops_with_r/","publishdate":"2020-12-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/02_parallelizing_loops_with_r/","section":"post","summary":"Note: to better follow this tutorial you can download the .Rmd file from here.\nIn a previous post I explained how to set up a small home cluster.

A few months ago I connected it with my two laptops (one of them deceased now, RIP my dear skynet) to create a little cluster to run parallel tasks in R.\nIt was just a draft cluster running on a wireless network, but it served me to think about getting a more permanent solution not requiring two additional laptops in my desk.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s were the nice INTEL NUCs (from Next Unit of Computing) come into play. NUCs are full-fledged computers fitted in small boxes usually sold without RAM memory sticks and no hard disk (hence the term barebone). Since they have a low energy consumption footprint, I thought these would be ideal units for my soon-to-be home cluster.\nMaterial I gifted myself with:\n2 Intel Barebone BOXNUC6CAYH, each with 4 cores, and a maximum RAM memory of 32GB (you might read they only accept 8GB, but that\u0026rsquo;s not the case anymore). Notice that these NUCs aren\u0026rsquo;t state-of-the-art now, they were released by the end of 2016. 2 Hard disks SSD 2.5\u0026quot; Western Digital WDS250G2B0A WD Blue (250GB) 4 Crucial CT102464BF186D DDR3 SODIMM (204 pins) RAM sticks with 8GB each. 1 ethernet switch Netgear GS308-300PES with 8 ports. 3 ethernet wires NanoCable 10.20.0400-BL of cat 6 quality. The whole set came to cost around 530â¬, but please notice that I had a clear goal in mind: \u0026ldquo;duplicating\u0026rdquo; my computing power with the minimum number of NUCs, while preserving a share of 4GB of RAM memory per CPU throughout the cluster (based on the features of my desk computer). A more basic setting with more modest NUCs and smaller RAM would cost half of that.\nThis instructive video by David Harry shows how to install the SSD and the RAM sticks in an Intel NUC. It really takes 5 minutes tops, one only has to be a bit careful with the RAM sticks, the pins need to go all the way in into their slots before securing the sticks in place.\nNetwork settings Before starting to install an operating system in the NUCS, the network setup goes as follows:\nMy desktop PC is connected to a router via WIFI and dynamic IP (DHCP). The PC and each NUC are connected to the switch with cat6 ethernet wires. To share my PC\u0026rsquo;s WIFI connection with the NUCs I have to prepare a new connection profile with the command line tool of Ubuntu\u0026rsquo;s NetworkManager, named nmcli, as follows.\nFirst, I need to find the name of my ethernet interface by checking the status of my network devices with the command line.\nnmcli device status DEVICE TYPE STATE CONNECTION wlp3s0 wifi connected my_wifi enp2s0 ethernet unavailable -- lo loopback unmanaged -- There I can see that my ethernet interface is named enp2s0.\nSecond, I have to configure the shared connection.\nnmcli connection add type ethernet ifname enp2s0 ipv4.method shared con-name cluster Were ifname enp2s0 is the name of the interface I want to use for the new connection, ipv4.method shared is the type of connection, and con-name cluster is the name I want the connection to have. This operation adds firewall rules to manage traffic within the cluster network, starts a DHCP server in the computer that serves IPs to the NUCS, and a DNS server that allows the NUCs to translate internet addresses.\nAfter turning on the switch, I can check the connection status again with\nnmcli device status DEVICE TYPE STATE CONNECTION enp2s0 ethernet connected cluster wlp3s0 wifi connected my_wifi lo loopback unmanaged -- When checking the IP of the device with bash ifconfig it should yield 10.42.0.1. Any other computer in the cluster network will have a dynamic IP in the range 10.42.0.1/24.\nFurther details about how to set a shared connection with NetworkManager can be found in this nice post by Beniamino Galvani.\nSSH setup My PC, as the director of the cluster, needs an SSH client running, while the NUCs need an SSH server. SSH (Secure Shell) is a remote authentication protocol that allows secure connections to remote servers that I will be using all the time to manage the cluster. To install, run, and check its status I just have to run these lines in the console:\nsudo apt install ssh sudo systemctl enable --now ssh sudo systemctl status ssh Now, a secure certificate of the identity of a given computer, named ssh-key, that grants access to remote ssh servers and services needs to be generated.\nssh-keygen \u0026quot;label\u0026quot; Here, substitute \u0026ldquo;label\u0026rdquo; by the name of the computer to be used as cluster\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;director\u0026rdquo;. The system will ask for a file name and a passphrase that will be used to encrypt the ssh-key.\nThe ssh-key needs to be added to the ssh-agent.\nssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa To copy the ssh-key to my GitHub account, I have to copy the contents of the file ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub (can be done just opening it with gedit ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub + Ctrl + a + Ctrl + c), and paste it on GitHub account \u0026gt; Settings \u0026gt; SSH and GPG keys \u0026gt; New SSH Key (green button in the upper right part of the window).\nNote: If you don\u0026rsquo;t use GitHub, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to copy your ssh-key to the NUCs once they are up and running with ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub user_name@nuc_IP.\nInstalling and preparing ubuntu server in each NUC The NUCs don\u0026rsquo;t need to waste resources in a user graphical interface I won\u0026rsquo;t be using whatsoever. Since they will work in a headless configuration once the cluster is ready, a Linux distro without graphical user interface such as Ubuntu server is the way to go.\nInstalling Ubuntu server First it is important to connect a display, a keyboard, and a mouse to the NUC in preparation, and turn it on while pushing F2 to start the visual BIOS. These BIOS parameters need to be modified:\nAdvanced (upper right) \u0026gt; Boot \u0026gt; Boot Configuration \u0026gt; UEFI Boot \u0026gt; OS Selection: Linux Advanced \u0026gt; Boot \u0026gt; Boot Configuration \u0026gt; UEFI Boot \u0026gt; OS Selection: mark \u0026ldquo;Boot USB Devices First\u0026rdquo;. [optional] Advanced \u0026gt; Power \u0026gt; Secondary Power Settings \u0026gt; After Power Failure: \u0026ldquo;Power On\u0026rdquo;. I have the switch and nucs connected to an outlet plug extender with an interrupter. When I switch it on, the NUCs (and the switch) boot automatically after this option is enabled, so I only need to push one button to power up the cluster. F10 to save, and shutdown. To prepare the USB boot device with Ubuntu server 20.04 I first download the .iso from here, by choosing \u0026ldquo;Option 3\u0026rdquo;, which leads to the manual install. Once the .iso file is downloaded, I use Ubuntu\u0026rsquo;s Startup Disk Creator to prepare a bootable USB stick. Now I just have to plug the stick in the NUC and reboot it.\nThe Ubuntu server install is pretty straightforward, and only a few things need to be decided along the way:\nAs user name I choose the same I have in my personal computer. As name for the NUCs I choose \u0026ldquo;nuc1\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;nuc2\u0026rdquo;, but any other option will work well. As password, for comfort I use the same I have in my personal computer. During the network setup, choose DHCP. If the network is properly configured and the switch is powered on, after a few seconds the NUC will acquire an IP in the range 10.42.0.1/24, as any other machine within the cluster network. When asked, mark the option \u0026ldquo;Install in the whole disk\u0026rdquo;, unless you have other plans for your NUC. Mark \u0026ldquo;Install OpenSSH\u0026rdquo;. Provide it with your GitHub user name if you have your ssh-key there, and it will download it right away, facilitating a lot the ssh setup. Reboot once the install is completed. Now I keep configuring the NUC\u0026rsquo;s operating system from my PC through ssh.\nConfiguring a NUC First, to learn the IP of the NUC:\nsudo arp-scan 10.42.0.1/24 Other alternatives to this command are arp -a and sudo arp-scan -I enp2s0 --localnet. Once I learn the IP of the NUC, I add it to the file etc/hosts of my personal computer as follows.\nFirst I open the file as root.\nsudo gedit /etc/hosts Add a new line there: 10.42.0.XXX nuc1 and save the file.\nNow I access the NUC trough ssh to keep preparing it without a keyboard and a display. I do it from Tilix, that allows to open different command line tabs in the same window, which is quite handy to manage several NUCs at once.\nAnother great option to manage the NUCs through ssh is terminator, that allows to broadcast the same commands to several ssh sessions at once. I have been trying it, and it is much better for cluster management purposes than Tilix. Actually, using it would simplify this workflow a lot, because once Ubuntu server is installed on each NUC, the rest of the configuration commands can be broadcasted at once to both NUCs. It\u0026rsquo;s a bummer I discovered this possibility way too late!\nssh blas@10.42.0.XXX The NUC\u0026rsquo;s operating system probably has a bunch of pending software updates. To install these:\nsudo apt-get upgrade Now I have to install a set of software packages that will facilitate managing the cluster\u0026rsquo;s network and the NUC itself.\nsudo apt install net-tools arp-scan lm-sensors dirmngr gnupg apt-transport-https ca-certificates software-properties-common samba libopenmpi3 libopenmpi-dev openmpi-bin openmpi-common htop Setting the system time To set the system time of the NUC to the same you have in your computer, just repeat these steps in every computer in the cluster network.\n#list time zones: timedatectl list-timezones #set time zone sudo timedatectl set-timezone Europe/Madrid #enable timesyncd sudo timedatectl set-ntp on Setting the locale The operating systems of the NUCs and the PC need to have the same locale. It can be set by editing the file /etc/default/locale with either nano (in the NUCS) or gedit (in the PC) and adding these lines, just replacing en_US.UTF-8 with your preferred locale.\nLANG=\u0026ldquo;en_US.UTF-8\u0026rdquo;\nLANGUAGE=\u0026ldquo;en_US:en\u0026rdquo;\nLC_NUMERIC=\u0026ldquo;en_US.UTF-8\u0026rdquo;\nLC_TIME=\u0026ldquo;en_US.UTF-8\u0026rdquo;\nLC_MONETARY=\u0026ldquo;en_US.UTF-8\u0026rdquo;\nLC_PAPER=\u0026ldquo;en_US.UTF-8\u0026rdquo;\nLC_IDENTIFICATION=\u0026ldquo;en_US.UTF-8\u0026rdquo;\nLC_NAME=\u0026ldquo;en_US.UTF-8\u0026rdquo;\nLC_ADDRESS=\u0026ldquo;en_US.UTF-8\u0026rdquo;\nLC_TELEPHONE=\u0026ldquo;en_US.UTF-8\u0026rdquo;\nLC_MEASUREMENT=\u0026ldquo;en_US.UTF-8\u0026rdquo;\nTemperature monitoring NUCs are prone to overheating when under heavy loads for prolonged times. Therefore, monitoring the temperature of the NUCs CPUs is kinda important. In a step before I installed lm-sensors in the NUC, which provides the tools to do so. To setup the sensors from an ssh session in the NUC:\nsudo sensors-detect The program will request permission to find sensors in the NUC. I answered \u0026ldquo;yes\u0026rdquo; to every request. Once all sensors are identified, to check them\nsensors iwlwifi_1-virtual-0 Adapter: Virtual device temp1: N/A acpitz-acpi-0 Adapter: ACPI interface temp1: +32.0Â°C (crit = +100.0Â°C) coretemp-isa-0000 Adapter: ISA adapter Package id 0: +30.0Â°C (high = +105.0Â°C, crit = +105.0Â°C) Core 0: +30.0Â°C (high = +105.0Â°C, crit = +105.0Â°C) Core 1: +30.0Â°C (high = +105.0Â°C, crit = +105.0Â°C) Core 2: +29.0Â°C (high = +105.0Â°C, crit = +105.0Â°C) Core 3: +30.0Â°C (high = +105.0Â°C, crit = +105.0Â°C) which gives the cpu temperatures at the moment the command was executed. The command watch sensors gives continuous temperature readings instead.\nTo control overheating in my NUCs I removed their top lids, and installed them into a custom LEGO \u0026ldquo;rack\u0026rdquo; with external USB fans with velocity control, as shown in the picture at the beginning of the post.\nInstalling R To install R in the NUCs I just proceed as I would when installing it in my personal computer. There is a thorough guide here.\nIn a step above I installed all the pre-required software packages. Now I only have to add the security key of the R repository, add the repository itself, update the information on the packages available in the new repository, and finally install R.\nsudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys E298A3A825C0D65DFD57CBB651716619E084DAB9 sudo add-apt-repository 'deb https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu focal-cran40/' sudo apt update sudo apt install r-base Note: If R has issues to recognize the system locale\nnano ~/.profile add the following lines, replacing en_US.UTF-8 with your preferred locale\nexport LANG=en_US.UTF-8 export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8\nsave, and execute the file to export the locale so R can read it.\n. ~/.profile Finalizing the network configuration Each NUC needs firewall rules to grant access from other computers withinn the cluster network. To activate the NUC\u0026rsquo;s firewall and check what ports are open:\nsudo ufw enable sudo ufw status To grant access from the PC to the NUC through ssh, and later through R for parallel computing, the ports 22 and 11000 must be open for the IP of the PC (10.42.0.1).\nsudo ufw allow ssh sudo ufw allow from 10.42.0.1 to any port 11000 sudo ufw allow from 10.42.0.1 to any port 22 Finally, the other members of the cluster network must be declared in the /etc/hosts file of each computer.\nIn each NUC edit the file through ssh with bash sudo nano /etc/hosts and add the lines\n10.42.0.1 pc_name\n10.42.0.XXX name_of_the_other_nuc\nIn the PC, add the lines\n10.42.0.XXX name_of_one_nuc\n10.42.0.XXX name_of_the_other_nuc\nAt this point, after rebooting every machine, the NUCs must be accessible through ssh by using their names (ssh username@nuc_name) instead of their IPs (ssh username@n10.42.0.XXX). Just take in mind that, since the cluster network works with dynamic IPs (and such setting cannot be changed in a shared connection), the IPs of the NUCs might change if a new device is added to the network. That\u0026rsquo;s something you need to check from the PC with sudo arp-scan 10.42.0.1/24, to update every /etc/hosts file accordingly.\nI think that\u0026rsquo;s all folks. Good luck setting your home cluster! Next time I will describe how to use it for parallel computing in R.\n","date":1607299200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1607299200,"objectID":"ead52a439ba25afd3dd271401b5f5734","permalink":"https://blasbenito.com/post/01_home_cluster/","publishdate":"2020-12-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/01_home_cluster/","section":"post","summary":"In this post I explain how to setup a small Beowulf cluster with a personal PC running Ubuntu 20.04 and a couple of Intel NUCs running Ubuntu Server 20.04, with the end-goal of parallelizing R tasks.","tags":null,"title":"Setting up a home cluster","type":"post"},{"authors":["Masahiro Ryo","Boyan Angelov","Stefano Mammola","Jamie M.

The authors present the results of an ensemble forecast made from a suite of species distribution models (SDMs), where they attempt to predict the suitability of the climate for the spread of SARS-CoV-2 over the coming months.

A central finding of their study is that the possibility of a synchronous global pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 is unlikely.

We tested this hypothesis using experiments in 215 species and leafâout monitoring in 1585 species from East Asia (EA), Europe (EU) and North America (NA). The results reveal that species from regions with high STV indeed have higher winter chilling requirements, and, when grown under the same conditions, leaf out later than related species from regions with lower STV. Since 1900, STV has been consistently higher in NA than in EU and EA, and under experimentally short winter conditions NA species required 84% more spring warming for bud break, EU ones 49% and EA ones only 1%. These previously unknown continentalâscale differences in phenological strategies underscore the need for considering regional climate histories in global change models.","tags":["Phenology","Biogeography","Plant Ecology"],"title":"Spring predictability explains different leafâout strategies in the woody floras of North America, Europe and East Asia","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Constantin M.

By contrast, in regions with short winters, some speciesâmostly from lineages with a warm-temperate or subtropical background, for example, Fagus additionally rely on photoperiodism.

In fact, they are considered Priority Habitat by Directive 92/43/EEC. These are ecologically valuable plant communities found in the southeast of Spain. By combining modeling methods of environmental variables, historical photo-interpretation, and fieldwork, a chronosequence of the evolution of their extent of occurrence (EOO) has been reconstructed in 1957 and 2011. Results showed a strong regression range of *Maytenus senegalensis* subsp. *europaea* populations. More than 26,000 ha of EOO for this species have been lost in the province of AlmerÃ­a. Considering the final number of polygons, this area has been fragmented 18 times since the 1950s. These results reinforce the idea that the alteration and fragmentation of habitat due to human activities is one of the most important drivers of biodiversity loss and global change. These activities are mostly intensive greenhouse agriculture and urbanization without sustainable land planning. Knowledge about the distribution of M. senegalensis subsp. europaea is of great interest for future habitat restoration. Therefore, this would be the key species to recover these damaged ecosystems.","tags":["Species distribution models","Biodiversity conservation","Ecoinformatics","Habitat loss"],"title":"Extreme habitat loss in a Mediterranean habitat: Maytenus senegalensis subsp. europaea","type":"publication"},{"authors":["JosÃ© Miguel Barea-AzcÃ³n","Blas M.

In this paper, we propose a conceptual framework to design and implement a web application that will help to meet this challenge. This tool will foster cooperation among scientists, enhancing the creation of relevant knowledge that could be transferred to environmental managers. We have implemented this conceptual framework in a tool called ModeleR. This is being used to document, share, and execute more than 200 models and analytical processes associated with a global change monitoring program that is being undertaken in the Sierra Nevada Mountains (south Spain). ModeleR uses the concept of scientific workflow to connect and execute different types of models and analytical processes. Finally, we have envisioned the creation of a federation of model repositories where models documented within a local repository could be linked and even executed by other researchers.","tags":["Ecoinformatics"],"title":"Documenting, storing, and executing models in Ecology: A conceptual framework and real implementation in a global change monitoring program","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Blas M.
