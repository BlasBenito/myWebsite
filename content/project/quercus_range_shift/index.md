This Netlogo model simulates the dispersal of Quercus pyrenaica populations in Sierra Nevada (Spain) at a yearly resolution until 2100 while considering different levels of model complexity, from random dispersal and seedling establishment, to realistic dispersal based on the dispersal behavior of the Eurasian Jay.

The data required to run the model can be downloaded from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/zsjja2g3yrgqyl1/data.zip?dl=1). It must be decompressed in the same folder containing the netlogo code of the model.

The video below shows the model in action for one population of *Quercus pyrenaica*. On the left, it shows the effect of a random dispersal model, and on the right, a realistic dispersal model based on observations of the dispersal behavior of the Eurasian Jay.
