## Summary

This post showcases the applications of the R package [`distantia`](https://blasbenito.github.io/distantia/) to the analysis of epidemiological time series.

The data used in this tutorial comprises univariate time series of Covid-19 prevalence at weekly resolution from 36 counties in California between 2020-03-16 to 2023-12-18.

This post is divided into these sections:

- **Data Preparation**: describes how to transform the original data into a *time series list*, the format used by `distantia`.

- **Exploration**: shows how to obtain an overview of main data features via visualization and computing descriptive statistics.

- **Computing Dissimilarity Scores**: explains how to compute time series dissimilarity scores using lock-step and dynamic time warping.

- **Analyzing Dissimilarity Scores**: this section shows several methods to gain insights from dissimilarity scores, such as hierarchical clustering and mapping, and dissimilarity modelling.

**DISCLAIMER:** I am **not** an epidemiologist, so I will refrain from interpreting any results shown herein. Instead, I will focus on technical details about the usage of `distantia` on this kind of data. If at any point I go beyond the red line I am drawing here, please ignore me, because I might just be forgetting about it.

## R packages

This tutorial requires the following packages:

- [`distantia`](https://blasbenito.github.io/distantia/): time series analysis via dynamic time warping.
- [`zoo`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/zoo/index.html): management of regular and irregular time series.
- [`dplyr`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/): data frame manipulation.
- [`mapview`](https://r-spatial.github.io/mapview/): easy to use interactive map visualization.
- [`reactable`](https://glin.github.io/reactable/): interactive tables.
- [`factoextra`](https://rpkgs.datanovia.com/factoextra/index.html): plot results of hierarchical clustering.
- [`visreg`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=visreg): response curves of statistical models.
- [`ranger`](https://github.com/imbs-hl/ranger): random forest modelling.

library(coefplot)
library(visreg)
library(ranger)
```

## Example Data

This demo focuses on two example data frames shipped with `distantia`: `covid_counties` and `covid_prevalence`.

### `covid_counties`

This dataset comprises county polygons and several socioeconomic variables stored as a [`simple features`](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) data frame. It is connected to `covid_prevalence` by the county name stored in the column `name`.

<p>
California counties represented in the Covid-19 dataset.
</p>
</iframe>

The socioeconomic variables available in this dataset are:

- `area_hectares`: county surface.
- `population`: county population.
- `poverty_percentage`: population percentage below the poverty line.
- `median_income`: median county income in dollars.
- `domestic_product`: yearly domestic product in **b**illions (not a typo) of dollars.
- `daily_miles_traveled`: daily miles traveled by the average inhabitant.
- `employed_percentage`: percentage of the county population under employment.

Please, take in mind that these variables were included in the dataset because they were easy to capture from on-line sources, not because of their importance for epidemiological analyses.

### `covid_prevalence`

Data frame with weekly Covid-19 prevalence in 36 California counties between 2020-03-16 and 2023-12-18. It is derived from a daily prevalence dataset available [here](https://github.com/BlasBenito/distantia/blob/main/data_full/covid_prevalence.rda).

The prevalence time series has the columns `name`, `time`, with the date of the first day of the week each data point represents, and `prevalence`, expressed as proportion of positive tests. The table below shows the first rows of this data frame.

## Data Preparation

This section shows how to transform the data frame `covid_prevalence` into a format compatible with `distantia`.

A **time series list**, or `tsl` for short, is a list of [`zoo`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/zoo/index.html) time series representing unique realizations of the same phenomena observed in different sites, times, or individuals. All [data manipulation](https://blasbenito.github.io/distantia/articles/time_series_lists.html) and analysis functions in `distantia` are designed to be applied to all time series in a `tsl` at once.

The function `tsl_initialize()` transforms time series stored as long data frames into time series lists.

``` r
tsl <- distantia::tsl_initialize(
  x = covid_prevalence,
  name_column = "name",
  time_column = "time"
)
```

Each element in `tsl` is named after the county the data belongs to.

``` r
names(tsl)
```

    ##  [1] "Alameda"         "Butte"           "Contra_Costa"    "El_Dorado"      
    ##  [5] "Fresno"          "Humboldt"        "Imperial"        "Kern"           
    ##  [9] "Kings"           "Los_Angeles"     "Madera"          "Marin"          
    ## [13] "Merced"          "Monterey"        "Napa"            "Orange"         
    ## [17] "Placer"          "Riverside"       "Sacramento"      "San_Bernardino" 
    ## [21] "San_Diego"       "San_Francisco"   "San_Joaquin"     "San_Luis_Obispo"
    ## [25] "San_Mateo"       "Santa_Barbara"   "Santa_Clara"     "Santa_Cruz"     
    ## [29] "Shasta"          "Solano"          "Sonoma"          "Stanislaus"     
    ## [33] "Sutter"          "Tulare"          "Ventura"         "Yolo"

The `zoo` objects within `tsl` also have the attribute `name` to help track the data in case it is extracted from the time series list.

``` r
attributes(tsl[[1]])$name
```

    ## [1] "Alameda"

``` r
attributes(tsl[[2]])$name
```

    ## [1] "Butte"

Each individual `zoo` object comprises a time index and a data matrix.

``` r
zoo::index(tsl[["Alameda"]]) |> 
  head()
```

    ## [1] "2020-03-16" "2020-03-23" "2020-03-30" "2020-04-06" "2020-04-13"
    ## [6] "2020-04-20"

``` r
zoo::coredata(tsl[["Alameda"]]) |> 
  head()
```

    ##   prevalence
    ## 1       0.01
    ## 2       0.01
    ## 3       0.01
    ## 4       0.01
    ## 5       0.01
    ## 6       0.02

## Exploration

This section describes the tools in `distantia` that may help develop an intuition on the properties of the data at hand, either via visualization or descriptive analysis.

### Visualization

The function `tsl_plot()` provides a static multipanel visualization of a large number of time series at once.

``` r
distantia::tsl_plot(
  tsl = tsl,
  columns = 3,
  guide = FALSE,
  text_cex = 1.2
)
```

<img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" width="768" />

Combined with `tsl_subset()`, it can help focus on particular counties and zoom-in over specific time periods.

``` r
distantia::tsl_plot(
  tsl = tsl_subset(
    tsl = tsl,
    names = c("Los_Angeles", "Kings"),
    time = c("2021-09-01", "2022-01-31")
  ),
  guide = FALSE
)
```

<img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" width="768" />

### Descriptive Stats

Time series have at least two dimensions of interest: *time*, and the variable/s of interest, such as prevalence in this case.

Having a good understanding of the time features of a time series is important, because some data management decisions depend on it. Details like length, resolution, time units, or regularity may define how we design an analysis. In `distantia`, the function `tsl_time()` provides all relevant details about the time in your time series list.

``` r
df_time <- distantia::tsl_time(
  tsl = tsl
)
```

Here, all time series are regular and have the same time resolution and range, which makes the table above rightfully boring.

Once acquainted with time, having a summary of the values in each time series also helps make sense of the main properties of the data. The function `tsl_stats()` summarizes several important statistical properties of the time series in `tsl`.

``` r
df_stats <- distantia::tsl_stats(
  tsl = tsl,
  lags = 1:6 #weeks
)
```

The first part of the output corresponds with common statistical descriptors, such as centrality and dispersion metrics, and higher moments.

The second part of the output, produced by the `lags` argument, shows time series autocorrelation (Moran’s I) for different time lags. Since the resolution of all time series is 7 days per data-point, each time lag represents a week. A value of 0.9 for the lag 1 indicates the Pearson correlation between the prevalence of each data point and its precedent neighbor.

The stats produced by `tsl_stats()` can be joined to the spatial data frame `covid_counties` using their common column `name` to link cases.

``` r
sf_stats <- dplyr::inner_join(
  x = covid_counties[, "name"],
  y = df_stats,
  by = "name"
)
```

This join facilitates mapping any of the descriptive stats. For example, the map below shows the maximum prevalence per county across the complete time period.

``` r
mapview::mapview(
  sf_stats, 
  zcol = "q3",
  layer.name = "Max prevalence",
  label = "name",
  col.regions = distantia::color_continuous()
  )
```

<iframe src="max_prevalence.html" name="Max_prevalence" width="600" height="600" scrolling="auto" frameborder="0">
<p>
Maximum Covid-19 prevalence in California counties.
</p>
</iframe>

The functions `tsl_subset()` and `tsl_stats()` can be combined to generate stats focused in a given period of time or sub-group of time series. As example, the code below illustrates how to generate the stats for the year 2021.

``` r
df_stats_2021 <- distantia::tsl_stats(
  tsl = tsl_subset(
    tsl = tsl,
    time = c("2021-01-01", "2021-12-31")
  ),
  lags = 1:6
)
```

## Computing Dissimilarity Scores

The package `distantia` is specifically designed to compare time series, and provides two general methods to do so: *Lock-Step (LS)* and [*Dynamic time warping (DTW)*](https://www.blasbenito.com/post/dynamic-time-warping/).

### Dynamic Time Warping and Lock-Step Comparison

The *LS* method directly compares samples observed at the same time in time series of the same length. It is computationally efficient and easy to interpret but cannot account for differences in outbreak speed or timing, potentially missing underlying similarities when outbreaks are not synchronized.

*DTW* warps the time axis of the compared time series to maximize shape similarity. It adjusts for differences in the speed and timing of outbreaks, such as epidemic waves peaking at different times in different regions, and works well with time series of varying lengths or temporal resolutions. However, DTW is computationally expensive for large data sets, can be harder to interpret, and is sensitive to data scaling.

Before going forward, let me show a little example to help develop a sense of how DTW and LS work on a small subset of our time series. The figure below shows two years of data for San Francisco, Napa, and Solano.

<img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-21-1.png" width="768" />
At first glance, Napa and Solano seem quite well synchronized and look very similar. On the other hand, San Francisco, in spite of having the same number of events as the other two, shows a timing difference of several months.

The table below shows the **LS** comparison between these time series. The `psi` column indicates the dissimilarity between pairs of time series.

``` r
tsl_smol |> 
  distantia::distantia_ls() |> 
  dplyr::mutate(
    psi = round(psi, 3)
  ) |> 
  reactable::reactable(
    resizable = TRUE,
    striped = TRUE,
    compact = TRUE,
    wrap = FALSE,
    fullWidth = FALSE
  )
```

<div class="reactable html-widget html-fill-item" id="htmlwidget-5" style="width:auto;height:auto;"></div>
<script type="application/json" data-for="htmlwidget-5">{"x":{"tag":{"name":"Reactable","attribs":{"data":{"x":["Napa","San_Francisco","San_Francisco"],"y":["Solano","Napa","Solano"],"psi":[0.832,3.868,4.586]},"columns":[{"id":"x","name":"x","type":"character"},{"id":"y","name":"y","type":"character"},{"id":"psi","name":"psi","type":"numeric"}],"resizable":true,"striped":true,"compact":true,"nowrap":true,"inline":true,"dataKey":"4f7ced954331097202e29c7924188d61"},"children":[]},"class":"reactR_markup"},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

<br>

As expected, LS captures the synchronicity between Napa and Solano quite well, and returns a `psi` score indicating a high similarity. Meanwhile, San Francisco shows a high `psi` score when compared with the other two time series, indicating dissimilarity due to its asynchronous pattern. So far so good!

Now, let’s take a look at the **DTW** result:

``` r
tsl_smol |> 
  distantia::distantia_dtw() |> 
  dplyr::mutate(
    psi = round(psi, 3)
  ) |> 
  reactable::reactable(
    resizable = TRUE,
    striped = TRUE,
    compact = TRUE,
    wrap = FALSE,
    fullWidth = FALSE
  )
```

<div class="reactable html-widget html-fill-item" id="htmlwidget-6" style="width:auto;height:auto;"></div>
<script type="application/json" data-for="htmlwidget-6">{"x":{"tag":{"name":"Reactable","attribs":{"data":{"x":["San_Francisco","San_Francisco","Napa"],"y":["Solano","Napa","Solano"],"psi":[0.354,0.43,0.555]},"columns":[{"id":"x","name":"x","type":"character"},{"id":"y","name":"y","type":"character"},{"id":"psi","name":"psi","type":"numeric"}],"resizable":true,"striped":true,"compact":true,"nowrap":true,"inline":true,"dataKey":"9d5e2b489d58400e27c2b889ada672a5"},"children":[]},"class":"reactR_markup"},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

<br>

Surprising, right? When cancelling out the time shift between time series, it turns out that San Francisco is more similar to Solano than Napa!

This happens because DTW ignores the dates of the observations, and can link one sample of one time series with one or several samples of the other time series. The plot below, shows first sample of San Francisco (first case of the dashed red line), with prevalence 0, is linked to all samples with prevalence 0 at the beginning of the Napa series. Since the distance of all these links is 0, this operation cancels out the difference in timing between both time series.

These DTW results indicate that, for the given period of time, San Francisco, Napa, and Solano might be parts of the same system, in spite of the time-delay between them. This is a conclusion that cannot be achieved when applying the lock-step method!

It is for this reason that DTW is preferable when outbreak timing varies significantly and shape similarity is more important than exact time alignment. On the other hand, LS is best applied when the question at hand is focused on time-series synchronization rather than shape similarity.

### DTW and LS with `distantia`

Now that the features of LS and DTW are clear, it is time to compute the dissimilarity between all time series. But a little word of advice first: This section shows how to work with LS and DTW for the sake of completeness. However, in a real analysis with a well-defined question, the most suitable method should be selected!

The most straightforward way of computing DTW and LS in `distantia`involves the functions `distantia_ls()` and `distantia_dtw()`.

The function `distantia_ls()` computes lock-step dissimilarity using euclidean distances by default. It returns a data frame with the columns `x` and `y` with the time series names, and the `psi` score.

``` r
df_psi_ls <- distantia::distantia_ls(
  tsl = tsl,
  distance = "euclidean"
  )

str(df_psi_ls)
```

    ## 'data.frame':	630 obs. of  3 variables:
    ##  $ x  : chr  "Napa" "Alameda" "Alameda" "Sacramento" ...
    ##  $ y  : chr  "Solano" "San_Mateo" "Contra_Costa" "Sonoma" ...
    ##  $ psi: num  0.873 1.066 1.162 1.258 1.292 ...
    ##  - attr(*, "type")= chr "distantia_df"

The function `distantia_dtw()` returns an output with the same structure, but in this case the column `psi` represents dissimilarity scores computed with dynamic time warping.

``` r
df_psi_dtw <- distantia::distantia_dtw(
  tsl = tsl
  )

str(df_psi_dtw)

## Analyzing Dissimilarity Scores

Having a dissimilarity data frame may be kinda cool, but it won’t get you very far by itself. To give you a push in the right direction, this section focuses on several analyses that can help unveil the underlying structure of the data set.

For the sake of simplicity, this section focuses on the DTW results alone. But if you wish to use the LS results instead, just replace `df_psi_dtw` with `df_psi_ls` in the code below.

``` r
df_psi <- df_psi_dtw
```

### Summary Stats

The functions `distantia_stats()` and `distantia_boxplot()` provide alternative summarized representations of dissimilarity (a data frame and a boxplot, respectively) via aggregation of `psi` values by time series.

``` r
df_psi_stats <- distantia::distantia_stats(
  df = df_psi
)

### Hierarchical Clustering

The functions `distantia_cluster_hclust()` and `distantia_cluster_kmeans()` are designed to apply hierarchical and K-means clustering to the data frames produced by `distantia_dtw()` and `distantia_ls()` right away. This section will be focusing on hierarchical clustering, which is more appropriate for the analysis of epidemiological time series.

By default, the function `distantia_cluster_hclust()` selects by itself the clustering method and the number of groups in the clustering solution via silhouette-width maximization (see [`distantia::utils_cluster_silhouette()`](https://blasbenito.github.io/distantia/reference/utils_cluster_silhouette.html) and [`distantia::utils_cluster_hclust_optimizer()`](https://blasbenito.github.io/distantia/reference/utils_cluster_hclust_optimizer.html) for further details).

``` r
psi_cluster <- distantia::distantia_cluster_hclust(
  df = df_psi
)

names(psi_cluster)
```

    ## [1] "cluster_object"   "clusters"         "silhouette_width" "df"              
    ## [5] "d"                "optimization"

The output is a list with several components, but these are the key ones:

- `df`: data frame with time series names, cluster group, and silhouette width.
- `cluster_object`: the output of `stats::hclust()`.

The object `df` has the column `silhouette_width`, in the range \[-1, 1\], which informs about how well each case fits within its assigned cluster:

- `<0`: misclassified.
- `≈0`: near decision boundary.
- `≈1`: well-clustered.

The hirarchical clustering highlights “Santa Cruz”, with a silhouette score of -0.049, as the county with the most dubious cluster membership.

The cluster object can be plotted as a dendrogram with `factoextra::fviz_dend()`.

``` r
#number of clusters
k <- psi_cluster$clusters

factoextra::fviz_dend(
  x = psi_cluster$cluster_object, 
  k = k, 
  k_colors = distantia::color_discrete(n = k),
  cex = 1,
  label_cols = "gray20",
  rect = TRUE,  
  horiz = TRUE,
  main = "",
  ylab = "Dissimilarity"
  )
```

<img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-35-1.png" width="768" />

Mapping these groups may be helpful for the ones like me not fully acquainted with the distribution of counties in California. To get there we first need to join `psi_cluster$df` to the spatial data frame `covid_counties`.

``` r
sf_cluster <- dplyr::inner_join(
  x = covid_counties[, "name"],
  y = psi_cluster$df,
  by = "name"
)
```

Now we can use `mapview::mapview()` again to plot cluster membership, but with a twist: we are going to code the silhouette score of each case as polygon transparency, with higher transparency indicating a lower silhouette width. This will help identify these cases that do not fully belong to their assigned groups.

Notice that to do so, the code below applies `distantia::f_rescale_local()` to rescale silhouette width between 0.1 and 1 to adjust it to what the argument `alpha.regions` expects.

``` r
mapview::mapview(
  sf_cluster, 
  zcol = "cluster",
  layer.name = "Cluster",
  label = "name",
  col.regions = distantia::color_discrete(n = k),
  alpha.regions = distantia::f_rescale_local(
    x = sf_cluster$silhouette_width, 
    new_min = 0.1
    )
  )
```

### Dissimilarity Modelling

Dissimilarity scores reveal the degree of interrelation between time series but do not explain the underlying reasons for their similarity/dissimilarity.

To fill this gap, this section shows how combining dissimilarity scores with geographic and socioeconomic variables to fit models may help unveil important drivers of dissimilarity between epidemiological time series.

#### Building a Model Frame

The function [`distantia_model_frame()`](https://blasbenito.github.io/distantia/reference/distantia_model_frame.html) combines dissimilarity scores (stored in `df_psi`) with other county variables (stored in `covid_counties`) to build a model frame.

``` r
df_model <- distantia::distantia_model_frame(
  response_df = df_psi,
  predictors_df = covid_counties,
  scale = FALSE
)
```

In the data frame `df_model`, the response variable `psi` (from `df_psi`) represents time series dissimilarity. On the other hand, each predictor in `covid_counties` is transformed into absolute differences between each pair of counties. For example, the value of the column `area_hectares` for the counties Sacramento and Sonoma is 1.5574908^{5} hectares. This is the absolute difference between the area of Sacramento (2.5695387^{5} hectares) and the area of Sonoma (4.1270295^{5} hectares).

Notice that the column `geographic_distance`, not in `covid_counties`, also showed up as a new column. This happens when the input of `predictors_df` is spatial data frame, like `covid_counties`.

The function `distantia_model_frame()` has a neat feature: it can combine different predictors into a new one!

In the example below, the predictors `poverty_percentage`, `median_income`, `employed_percentage`, `daily_miles_traveled` and `domestic_product` are scaled, their multivariate distances between pairs of counties are computed and stored in the column `economy`. This new variable represents overall differences in economy between counties.

Notice that the code below also scales the predictors, because in `distantia` version \<=2.0.2 the argument `scale` of `distantia_model_frame()` does not work as it should.

``` r
df_model <- distantia::distantia_model_frame(
  response_df = df_psi,
  predictors_df = covid_counties,
  composite_predictors = list(
    economy = c(
      "poverty_percentage",
      "median_income",
      "domestic_product",
      "employed_percentage",
      "daily_miles_traveled"
    )
  ),
  #scale = TRUE is broken in version <= 2.0.2
  scale = FALSE 
  ) |> 
  #selecting and renaming columns
  dplyr::transmute(
    psi, 
    economy, 
    population,
    area = area_hectares,
    distance = geographic_distance
  ) |> 
  #scale
  dplyr::mutate(
    dplyr::across(
      dplyr::all_of(c("economy", "distance", "population", "area")), 
      ~ as.numeric(scale(.x))
    )
  )
```

With these variables at hand now we are ready to better understand how the similarity/dissimilarity between prevalence time series changes as a function of differences in distance, area, economy, and population between counties.

#### Fitting a Linear Model

The model frame generated above shows no multicollinearity between predictors (you can check yourself with `cor(df_model[, -1])`), so it can be used right away fit a multiple regression model.

``` r
m <- stats::lm(
  formula = psi ~ distance + area + economy + population,
  data = df_model
)
```

<br>

The model has an R-squared of 0.35 and a standard error of the residuals (sigma) of 0.29. Model coefficients are shown below.

<div class="reactable html-widget html-fill-item" id="htmlwidget-12" style="width:auto;height:auto;"></div>
<script type="application/json" data-for="htmlwidget-12">{"x":{"tag":{"name":"Reactable","attribs":{"data":{"term":["distance","area","economy","population"],"estimate":[0.1499,0.0878,0.0829,0.0343],"std.error":[0.0121,0.0119,0.0117,0.012],"statistic":[12.3471,7.3858,7.0949,2.8659],"p.value":[0,0,0,0.0043]},"columns":[{"id":"term","name":"term","type":"character"},{"id":"estimate","name":"estimate","type":"numeric"},{"id":"std.error","name":"std.error","type":"numeric"},{"id":"statistic","name":"statistic","type":"numeric"},{"id":"p.value","name":"p.value","type":"numeric"}],"resizable":true,"striped":true,"showSortable":true,"dataKey":"615d0db09ce3b2a2c0888c6b62414e2c"},"children":[]},"class":"reactR_markup"},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

<br>

The coefficients table shows that all effects are statistically different than zero. The predictor `distance` has the largest effect estimate, which is almost twice the estimate of `area` and `economy`, and more than four times the estimate of `population`.

<img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-45-1.png" width="576" />

All predictors show a positive relationship with the response, meaning that increasing differences in distance, area, economy, and population leads to increased dissimilarity between the compared time series.

The dissimilarity model seems relatively strong, but, as the calibration plot below shows, it is also moderately biased.

``` r
df_model$psi_predicted <- stats::predict(object = m)

ggplot(df_model) + 
  aes(
    x = psi,
    y = psi_predicted
  ) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, col = "gray50") + 
  coord_fixed(
    xlim = range(c(df_model$psi, df_model$psi_predicted)),
    ylim = range(c(df_model$psi, df_model$psi_predicted))
  ) + 
  geom_smooth(
    method = "lm", 
    col = "red4",
    formula = y ~ x
    ) + 
  geom_abline(
    intercept = 0, 
    slope = 1,
    col = "black",
    lty = 2
  ) +
  labs(
    x = "Observed psi",
    y = "Predicted psi",
    title = "Calibration plot - Linear Model"
  ) +
  theme_bw()
```

<img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-46-1.png" width="336" />
The scatterplot of the observations (x axis) vs predictions shows that the model underpredicts high psi values and overpredict low psi values. This kind of bias indicates that there are relevant predictors, interactions, or transformations missing from the model.

#### Training a Random Forest Model

If the objective is obtaining a model with a stronger predictive ability, Random Forest always can help with that!

``` r
m <- ranger::ranger(
  formula = psi ~ distance + area + economy + population,
  data = df_model,
  importance = "permutation"
)
```

The random forest model has an R-squared (on the out-of-bag data) of 0.42, and as the permutation importance scores below show, it downplays the effects of `economy` and `population` when compared with the linear model.

<div class="reactable html-widget html-fill-item" id="htmlwidget-13" style="width:auto;height:auto;"></div>
<script type="application/json" data-for="htmlwidget-13">{"x":{"tag":{"name":"Reactable","attribs":{"data":{"variable":["distance","area","economy","population"],"importance":[0.0721,0.0324,0.0166,0.0092]},"columns":[{"id":"variable","name":"variable","type":"character"},{"id":"importance","name":"importance","type":"numeric"}],"resizable":true,"striped":true,"showSortable":true,"inline":true,"dataKey":"af625d2450f95368cd82bbb5adb60881"},"children":[]},"class":"reactR_markup"},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

Still, as the calibration plot below shows, it has a very small amount of prediction bias.

``` r
df_model$psi_predicted <- stats::predict(
  object = m, 
  data = df_model
  )$predictions

ggplot(df_model) + 
  aes(
    x = psi,
    y = psi_predicted
  ) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, col = "gray50") + 
  coord_fixed(
    xlim = range(c(df_model$psi, df_model$psi_predicted)),
    ylim = range(c(df_model$psi, df_model$psi_predicted))
  ) + 
  geom_smooth(
    method = "lm", 
    col = "red4",
    formula = y ~ x
    ) + 
  geom_abline(
    intercept = 0, 
    slope = 1,
    col = "black",
    lty = 2
