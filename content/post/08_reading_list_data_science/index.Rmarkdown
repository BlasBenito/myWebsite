This is a live post listing links to Data Science related posts and videos I consider to be interesting, high-quality, or even essential to better understand particular topics within such a wide field.

# Data 

## Preprocessing

[**Extending Target Encoding**](https://towardsdatascience.com/extending-target-encoding-443aa9414cae): post by [Daniele Micci-Barreca](https://www.aitimejournal.com/interview-with-daniele-micci-barreca-product-analytics-lead-data-science-google/30110/) explaining how he came up with the idea of target encoding, and its possible extensions.

[**Target encoding done the right way**](https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/target-encoding/): post by [Max Halford](https://maxhalford.github.io/bio/), Head of Data at [Carbonfact](https://www.carbonfact.com/), explaining in detail how to combine additive smoothing and target encoding.

## Handling and Management

### Apache Parquet

# Analysis and Modeling

## Modeling Methods

[**Unraveling Principal Component Analysis**](https://loreley.one/2024-09-pca/): This book, reviewed [here](https://loreley.one/2024-09-pca/), is a *tour of linear algebra* focused on intuitive explanations rather than mathematical demonstrations.

[**Mixed Models for Big Data**](https://m-clark.github.io/posts/2019-10-20-big-mixed-models/): This post by [Michael Clark](https://m-clark.github.io/about.html) (see entry below by the same author) reviews several mixed modelling approach for large data in R.

## Model Explainability

[**Model-Independent Score Explanation**](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-simple-model-independent-score-explanation-method-c17002d66da7): Post by [Daniele Micci-Barreca](https://www.aitimejournal.com/interview-with-daniele-micci-barreca-product-analytics-lead-data-science-google/30110/) on model explainability. It also explains a very clever method to better understand any model just from it's predictions.

[**AI Explanations whitepaper**](https://storage.googleapis.com/cloud-ai-whitepapers/AI%20Explainability%20Whitepaper.pdf): White paper of Google's "AI Explanations" product with a pretty good overall view of the state of the art of model explainability.

[**Towards A Rigorous Science of Interpretable Machine Learning**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08608): Pre-print by Finale Doshi-Velez and Been Kim offering a rigorous definition and evaluation of model interpretability.

## Spatial Analysis

[**PostGEESE? Introducing The DuckDB Spatial Extension**](https://duckdb.org/2023/04/28/spatial.html): In this post, the authors of [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) present the new PostGIS-like *spatial* extension for this popular in-process data base engine.

[**Geocomputation with Python**](https://py.geocompx.org/): A very nice book on geographic data analysis with Python.

# Coding

## General Concepts

[**A Philosophy Of Software Design**](https://archive.org/details/a-philosophy-of-software-design/mode/2up): This book by [John Ousterhout](https://web.stanford.edu/~ouster/cgi-bin/home.php) is full of high-level concepts and tips to help tackle software complexity. It's so good I had to buy a hard copy that now lives in my desk. [This post](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/a-philosophy-of-software-design-review/) by [Gergely Orosz](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/) offers a balanced review of the book.

[**Why You Shouldn't Nest Your Code**](https://youtu.be/CFRhGnuXG-4?si=7Xr3E9L7GFvoRJqA): In this wonderful video, [CodeAesthetic](https://www.youtube.com/@CodeAesthetic) explains in detail (and beautiful graphics!) a couple of methods to reduce the level of nesting in our code to improve readability and maintainability. This video has truly changed how I code in R!

## R

[**Beautiful Code, Because We’re Worth It!**](https://ropensci.org/blog/2024/02/22/beautiful-code/): This post by [Maëlle Salmon](https://mastodon.social/@maelle) (research software engineer), and [Yanina Bellini Saibene](https://fosstodon.org/@yabellini) (rOpenSci Community Manager) provides simple tips to help write more visually pleasant R code.

[**Coloring in R’s Blind Spot**](https://journal.r-project.org/articles/RJ-2023-071/): This article published in [The R Journal](https://journal.r-project.org/index.html) by [Achim Zeileis](https://www.zeileis.org/) (he has a [great analytics blog](https://www.zeileis.org/blog/) too!) and [Paul Murrel](https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~paul/) offers a great overview of the base R color functions, and offers specific advice on what color palettes work better in different scenarios.

[**Taking R to its limits: 70+ tips**](https://peerj.com/preprints/26605v1/): This pre-print (not peer-reviewed AFAIK) by Tsagris and Papadakis offers a long list of tips to speed-up computation with the R language. I think a few of these tips lack enough context or are poorly explained, but it's still a good resource to help optimize our R code.

[**Code Smell: Error Handling Eclipse** ](https://www.njtierney.com/post/2023/12/06/long-errors-smell/): This post by [Nick Tierney](https://fosstodon.org/@njtierney@aus.social) explains how to address these situations when *error checking code totally eclipses the intent of the code*.

I have a hard copy on my desk, and I am finding it pretty easy to follow. Also, the code examples are clearly explained, and they ramp up in a very consistent manner. 

[**Python Rgonomics**](https://www.emilyriederer.com/post/py-rgo/): In this post, [Emily Riederer](https://www.emilyriederer.com/about) offers a list of Python libraries with an "R feeling".

## Coding Workflow

[**How to use stacked PRs to unblock your entire team**](https://graphite.dev/blog/stacked-prs): This post in [Graphite](https://graphite.dev/)'s blog explains how to split large coding changes into small managed PRs (aka "stacked PRs") to avoid blocks when PR reviews are hard to come by.

# Other Fancy Things

Regrettably, the paper offers no code or data at all, but it's still an interesting read.

[**Large Models for Time Series and
Spatio-Temporal Data A Survey and Outlook**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.10196.pdf): This pre-print by Weng and collaborators reviews the current state of the art in spatio-temporal modelling with Large Language Models and Pre-Trained Foundation Models.
