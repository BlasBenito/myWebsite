I am biogeographer and ecological modeler with a PhD in Plant Ecology and Global Change, a Master in Geographical Information Systems, a Degree in Biology, and quite a bit of experience in applying state-of-the-art quantitative methods to better understand the processes shaping the distribution of biodiversity across space and time. 

My research activity is structured around five main lines, namely [*biogeography*](#biogeography), [*palaeoecology*](#palaeoecology),  [*testing and development of quantitative methods*](#methods), [*range shift*](#rangeshift), and [*biodiversity conservation*](#conservation).

**Biogeography**

*Why are species where they are?* is a question I have been passionate about since I was a child.

A keystone result of my personal interest in this topic is the multidisciplinary study I led on the distribution of Neanderthals during the Last Interglacial ([Benito *et al*. 2016](https://www.dropbox.com/s/asn5h45l4j5fy3c/2016_BMB_Journal_of_Biogeography.pdf?dl=1). This paper was highlighted at the Editor’s Picks section of Science ([Sugen 2017](https://www.dropbox.com/s/6k308eczv7i6kbj/2016_BMB_Journal_of_Biogeography_editors_choice.pdf?dl=1)), and was among the top 20 most downloaded papers of the journal of bigeography during 2018. In [Kellberg-Nielsen *et al*. (2017)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/p8zfrqb68gi23qr/2017_BMB_Quaternary_International.pdf?dl=1), led by my brilliant colleague [Trine Kellberg-Nielsen](https://trinekellbergnielsen.wordpress.com/) we further discuss the dispersal dynamics of Neanderthals in their northern edge.

I have also learned a a fair deal about the biogeography of plant phenology through my collaboration with the outstanding [Constantin Zohner](https://constantinzohner.wordpress.com/ueber/). In [Zohner *et al*. (2016)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/hmyovgva3c86e41/2016_BMB_Nature_Climate_Change.pdf?dl=1) we found that plant species from lower latitudes use spring photoperiod to trigger leaf-out, while boreal species do not use photoperiod as leaf-out signal. In a complementary study ([Zohner *et al*. (2017)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/8o1bgu4p5w51gjt/2017_BMB_Ecology_Letters.pdf?dl=1)) we found that plant species from regions with high spring temperature variability have higher winter chilling requirements than species living in more predictable environments. More recently, in [Zohner *et al*. (2020)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/jg5hnkdwojgbb9m/2020_BMB_PNAS.pdf?dl=1), we report increasing risks of late spring frosts in significant portions of European and Asian forests.

Last, but not least in this section are my collaborations with the excellent biogeographer [Gang Feng](https://gangfeng.weebly.com/index.html) on the links between climatic and anthropogenetic legacies and plant distributions. In [Feng *et al*. (2017)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ptx20e8pjhbdybj/2017_BMB_Global_Ecology_and_Biogeography.pdf?dl=1) we found that tree assemblages with large phylogenetic age differences among species mostly inhabit areas with relatively high long‐term climate stability. The same year, in [Feng *et al*. (2017)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/lb4sw4um9391koh/2017_BMB_Biological_Conservation.pdf?dl=1) we evaluated the relationship between the distribution of threatened species and land-use change legacies, to find that the current distribution of threatened plants in China happens in places where historical land-use intensity was low, but has increased in the last decades.

**Palaeoecology**

During the last years I have focused on applying state-of-the-art quantitative methods to better understand past ecological dynamics. Most of this work is a result of my ongoing collaboration with the bright [Graciela Gil-Romera](https://gilromera.com/). We recently developed a framework to apply ecological memory concepts to millennial timescales in [Benito *et al.* 2020](https://www.dropbox.com/s/uqaf717qf73nrxb/2020_BMB_Ecography_b.pdf?dl=1). This paper was highlighted as an *Editor's Choice* in the number 43 of the *Ecography* journal, and made it to the [top 10% most downloaded papers](https://www.dropbox.com/s/oacsy1xqx4omv1b/2020_BMB_Ecography_b_top_downloaded.png?dl=1) of the journal in the period 2018-2019, after it was published as *early view* in October 22, 2019. A very kind reviewer wrote the following to the handling editor: *"In my years of reviewing papers, this is by far one of the best and cleanest reviews I have encountered and the authors should be commended for that."*. That was a first in my research career!

I helped implement these memory conceptsto better understand the relationship between fire and *Erica spp.* in the Bale Mountains of Ethiopia during the Holocene ([Gil-Romera *et al.* 2019](https://www.dropbox.com/s/w5784kc2b9j8ewa/2019_BMB_Biology_Letters.pdf?dl=1)) and the Pyrenees [(Leunda *et al*. 2020)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/btya8msbt37anks/2020_BMB_Catena.pdf?dl=1).

**Testing and development of quantitative methods**

Understanding how quantitative methods work, developing new ones, and finding their limits of application are key axes of my research. 

However, this line of research started by designing and creating an infrastructure to document, store and execute the ecological models named *ModeleR*. This system, used to run the ecological models required by the [Global Change Observatory of Sierra Nevada](https://obsnev.es/en/), is described in [Perez, Benito and Bonet (2012)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/tc9uueq8oljenam/2012_BMB_Expert_systems_with_applications.pdf?dl=1) and [Bonet *et al* (2014)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/04vx2e8b39zu43q/2014_BMB_Environmental_Modelling_and_Software.pdf?dl=1).

In 2013 I compared the ability of stacked species distribution models based on different statistical and machine learning methods to predict tree species richness and composition in Mesoamerica [(Benito *et al.* 2013)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/fq2dvwnm1uhl265/2013_BMB_Methods_in_Ecology_and_Evolution.pdf?dl=1), and contributed to a comparison of SDMs to forecast the distribution of the seaweed *Zostera marina* in the Wadden Sea [(Tovar *et al.* 2013)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/lypd6105c50nkwt/2013_BMB_Journal_Sea_Research.pdf?dl=1).

After 10 years working with R I recently started to develop R packages. For example, the package [distantia](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=distantia) [(Benito *et al.* 2020)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/yepcz1i7ajzdci5/2020_BMB_Ecography_a.pdf?dl=1) implements several methods to quantify the dissimilarity among irregular multivariate time series. 

The package [memoria](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=memoria) implements a method based on Random Forest to evaluate ecological memory (effect of antecedent conditions on a response variable) in time series data. 

I also designed a mechanistical simulation to produce virtual pollen curves in the package [virtualPollen](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=virtualPollen). The model uses a set of drivers, the ecological niches of a virtual species for these drivers, the traits life-span and fecundity, and the carrying capacity of the forest plot to simulate population dynamics over thousands of years.  

![virtualPollen](media/virtualPollen.png) 

Currently I am working on two other packages. [sdmflow](https://github.com/BlasBenito/sdmflow) pretends to fully streamline the production of species distribution models based on the concept "use versus availability", where the background data (a comprehensive sampling of the ecological conditions available in the study area) represents the *availability*, and the presence represents the *use*. This is a project I am developing in my free time, so it will take some time to get it done. The second package remains nameless yet, but implements solutions to incorporate temporal and spatial autocorrelation to machine learning models such as random forest, gradient boosting, or artificial neural networks, among others.

**Range shift**

forecast suitability changes under climate change in a high mountain with species distribution models (Benito et al. 2011). Furthermore, to overcome the conceptual limitations of species distribution models to fully capture complex ecological dynamics, I have applied theoretical models and mechanistic simulations to forecast plant range shift under climate change with downscaled climate models (Benito et al. 2013 b). and the Sonoran desert (Albuquerque et al. 2018), assess the effect of species’

**Biodiversity conservation**

The first half of my PhD thesis was focused on understanding the threat posed by the expansion of greenhouses and habitat degradation on rare and endemic annual plants in the drylands of the Iberian Southwest. For example, I analyzed the historical habitat fragmentation of the habitat of *Linaria nigricans* using landscape fragmentation metrics ([Peñas, Benito *et al*. 2011](https://www.dropbox.com/s/f4szr8r2jmb55vz/2011_BMB_Environmental_management.pdf?dl=1)), and modelled future greenhouse expansion on protected dryland habitats through correlative ([Benito *et al*. 2009](https://www.dropbox.com/s/v3vz6yhkifki2ix/2009_BMB_Biodiversity_and_Conservation.pdf?dl=1)) and mechanistic models ([Benito and Peñas 2008](https://www.dropbox.com/s/jym53771y7pv8zv/2008_BMB_Environmental_Dynamics.pdf?dl=1)). 

Wthin this research line I have also also engaged in collaborations to better understand the distribution and conservation status of an endemic butterfly ([Azcón, Benito *et al* 2014](https://www.dropbox.com/s/rbp8q4k6qd8zntz/2014_BMB_Biodiversity_and_Conservation.pdf?dl=1)),  assess how well Special Protected Areas protect birds in Europe ([Albuquerque et al. 2013](https://www.dropbox.com/s/16nggzhg6yhx565/2013_BMB_Biological_Conservation.pdf?dl=1)), define the role of palaeoecology in conservation strategies ([Gill *et al*. 2015](https://www.dropbox.com/s/w0gx08dgzjytp0i/2015_BMB_Conservation_Biology.pdf?dl=1)), and find conservation gaps for tree diversity in Mesoamerica ([Albuquerque, Benito *et al*. 2015](https://www.dropbox.com/s/34u4vowgixcje2x/2015_BMB_Naturaleza_Conservacao.pdf?dl=1)).
