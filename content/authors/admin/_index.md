I am an ecological modeler and biogeographer with a PhD in Global Change Ecology, a Degree in Biology, a Master in Geographical Information Systems, and a Master in Environmental Management.

Reaching a deeper understanding on the role of climate and land-use-change in shaping species’ ecology and distribution through state-of-the-art quantitative methods is a pivotal objective of my research, that is structured around five research lines:

**Biodiversity conservation**: I have contributed to plant conservation books and have contributed to field work campaigns that resulted in the finding of plant species never reported before in the Iberian Peninsula (Peñas et al. 2008; Lorite et al. 2010).

forecast extinction risk of endangered plants in semi-arid grasslands (Benito et al. 2009, also Maxent and Biomod).  

evaluate habitat fragmentation (Peñas et al. 2011)


study of tree conservation gaps in Mesoamerica (Albuquerque
et al. 2015)

**Biogeography**:


evaluate how long-term climatic stability leads to phylogenetically diverse plant assemblages with large age differences among tree species (Feng et al. 2017). 

**Global change ecology**: forecast suitability changes under climate change in a high mountain with species distribution models (Benito et al. 2011). Furthermore, to overcome the conceptual limitations of species distribution models to fully capture complex ecological dynamics, I have applied theoretical models and mechanistic simulations to forecast plant range shift under climate change with downscaled climate models (Benito et al. 2013 b). and the Sonoran desert (Albuquerque et al. 2018), assess the effect of species’
geographic and climatic history on their phenological responses to Climate Change (Zohner et al.
2016; Zohner et al., 2017)

**Palaeoecology**: During the last years I have focused on applying state-of-the-art quantitative methods to better understand past ecological dynamics and human palaeoecology. I have collaborated with a multidisciplinary group of researchers to reconstructBlas Benito is a biogeographer and ecological modeller... [work in progress] the potential distribution of Neanderthals during the Last Interglacial (Benito et al. 2016; Kellberg-Nielsen 2017). Benito et al. (2016) was highlighted at the Editor’s Picks section of science (Sugen 2017), and was among the top 20 most downloaded papers of the journal of bigeography during 2018. paper to highlight the importance of palaeoecological knowledge
in supporting decision making in biodiversity conservation (Gill et al. 2015)

**Testing and development of quantitative methods**: I have used statistical and machine learning methods to evaluate the performance of different methods to model the distribution of tree diversity in Mesoamerica (Benito et al. 2013).
