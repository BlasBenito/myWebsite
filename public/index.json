[{"authors":["admin"],"categories":null,"content":"I am biogeographer and ecological modeler with a PhD in Plant Ecology and Global Change, a Master in Geographical Information Systems, a Degree in Biology, and quite a bit of experience in applying state-of-the-art quantitative methods to better understand the processes shaping the distribution of biodiversity across space and time.\nI have developed my research career as PhD student at the Department of Botany of the University of Granada (2006 - 2009), staff researcher at IISTA, postdoctoral researcher at ECOINFO (2014 - 2017, Aarhus University, Denmark), led by Jens-Christian Svenning, postdoctoral researcher at EECRG (2017 - 2019), and currently as senior researcher at Maestre Lab, led by Fernando T. Maestre.\nMy research activity is structured around five main lines, namely biogeography, testing and development of quantitative methods, palaeoecology, range shift, and biodiversity conservation.\n Biogeography\nWhy are species where they are? is a question I have been passionate about since I was a child.\nA keystone result of my personal interest in this topic is the multidisciplinary study I led on the distribution of Neanderthals during the Last Interglacial ( Benito et al. 2016. This paper was highlighted at the Editor’s Picks section of Science ( Sugen 2017), and was among the top 20 most downloaded papers of the Journal of Bigeography during 2018. In Kellberg-Nielsen et al. (2017), led by my brilliant colleague Trine Kellberg-Nielsen we further discuss the dispersal dynamics of Neanderthals in their northern edge.\nI have also learned a a fair deal about the biogeography of plant phenological strategies through my collaboration with the outstanding Constantin Zohner. In Zohner et al. (2016) we found that plant species from lower latitudes use spring photoperiod to trigger leaf-out, while boreal species do not use photoperiod as leaf-out signal. In a complementary study ( Zohner et al. (2017)) we found that plant species from regions with high spring temperature variability have higher winter chilling requirements than species living in more predictable environments. More recently, in Zohner et al. (2020), we report increasing risks of late spring frosts in significant portions of European and Asian forests.\nLast, but not least in this section are my collaborations with the excellent biogeographer Gang Feng on the links between climatic and anthropogenetic legacies and plant distributions. In Feng et al. (2017) we found that tree assemblages with large phylogenetic age differences among species mostly inhabit areas with relatively high long‐term climate stability. The same year, in Feng et al. (2017) we evaluated the relationship between the distribution of threatened species and land-use change legacies, to find that the current distribution of threatened plants in China happens in places where historical land-use intensity was low, but has increased in the last decades.\n Testing and development of quantitative methods\nUnderstanding how quantitative methods work, developing new ones, and finding their limits of application are key axes of my research.\nHowever, this line of research started by designing and creating an infrastructure to document, store and execute the ecological models named ModeleR. This system, used to run the ecological models required by the Global Change Observatory of Sierra Nevada, is described in Perez, Benito and Bonet (2012) and Bonet et al (2014).\nIn 2013 I compared the ability of stacked species distribution models based on different statistical and machine learning methods to predict tree species richness and composition in Mesoamerica (Benito et al. 2013), and contributed to a comparison of SDMs to forecast the distribution of the seaweed Zostera marina in the Wadden Sea (Tovar et al. 2013).\nRecently I engaged in a collaboration with modelers and epidemiologists to warn against the use of species distribution models to forecast the expansion of SARS-CoV-2. In Carlson et al. (2020) we discuss the limitations of SDMs to model the direct transmission of the virus, and in Carlson et al. (2020) we point out that speculation on the relationships between the distribution of the virus and climate hinder decision making and preparedness. In the preprint Chipperfield et al. (2020) and in Contina et al. (2020, in press) we criticize two different misapplications of SDMs to the expansion of the virus.\nR packages\nAfter 10 years working with R I recently started to develop R packages. For example, the package distantia (Benito et al. 2020) implements several methods to quantify the dissimilarity among irregular multivariate time series.\nThe package memoria implements a method based on Random Forest to evaluate ecological memory (effect of antecedent conditions on a response variable) in time series data.\nI also designed a mechanistical simulation to produce virtual pollen curves in the package virtualPollen. The model uses a set of drivers, the ecological niches of a virtual species for these drivers, the traits life-span and fecundity, and the carrying capacity of the forest plot to simulate population dynamics over thousands of years.\nCurrently I am working on two other packages: sdmflow intentds to streamline the production of species distribution models based on the concept \u0026ldquo;use versus availability\u0026rdquo;, where the background data (a comprehensive sampling of the ecological conditions available in the study area) represents the availability, and the presence represents the use. The second package (still nameless) incorporates temporal and spatial autocorrelation through Moran Eigenvector Maps to machine learning models such as random forest, gradient boosting, or artificial neural networks, among others.\n Palaeoecology\nDuring the last years I have focused on applying state-of-the-art quantitative methods to better understand past ecological dynamics. Most of this work is a result of my ongoing collaboration with the bright Graciela Gil-Romera. We recently developed a framework to apply ecological memory concepts to millennial timescales in Benito et al. 2020. This paper was highlighted as an Editor\u0026rsquo;s Choice in the number 43 of the Ecography journal, and made it to the top 10% most downloaded papers of the journal in the period 2018-2019, after it was published as early view in October 22, 2019. A very kind reviewer wrote the following to the handling editor: \u0026ldquo;In my years of reviewing papers, this is by far one of the best and cleanest reviews I have encountered and the authors should be commended for that.\u0026quot;. That was a first in my research career!\nI helped implement these memory conceptsto better understand the relationship between fire and Erica spp. in the Bale Mountains of Ethiopia during the Holocene ( Gil-Romera et al. 2019) and the Pyrenees (Leunda et al. 2020).\n Range shift\nGlobal warming is changing the geographic distribution of climate, and organisms respond by either shifting their distributions through dispersal and colonization of new habitats, resisting change in situ, or going extinct. Species distribution models (SDM), with the help of future climate simulations, allow to model changes in habitat suitability over time. For example, in Benito et al. (2011) I evaluated future suitability change for four vegetation types in the Sierra Nevada mountain range (Granada, Spain). I have also contributed to future suitability change projections for the emblematic saguaro (Carnegiea gigantea) in the Sonoran Desert (Albuquerque et al. 2018), and three grouse species in Kozma et al (2018). I have also worked with mechanistic models simulating dispersal to forecast plant range shift and extinction in the southern Iberian Peninsula (Benito et al 2014).\n Biodiversity conservation\nThe first half of my PhD thesis was focused on understanding the threat posed by the expansion of greenhouses and habitat degradation on rare and endemic annual plants in the drylands of the Iberian Southwest. For example, I analyzed the historical habitat fragmentation of the habitat of Linaria nigricans using landscape fragmentation metrics ( Peñas, Benito et al. 2011), and modelled future greenhouse expansion on protected dryland habitats through correlative ( Benito et al. 2009) and mechanistic models ( Benito and Peñas 2008).\nWithin this research line I have also also engaged in collaborations to better understand the distribution and conservation status of an endemic butterfly ( Azcón, Benito et al 2014), assess how well Special Protected Areas protect birds in Europe ( Albuquerque et al. 2013), define the role of palaeoecology in conservation strategies ( Gill et al. 2015), and find conservation gaps for tree diversity in Mesoamerica ( Albuquerque, Benito et al. 2015).\n","date":1605571200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1605571200,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"/author/blas-m.-benito/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/blas-m.-benito/","section":"authors","summary":"I am biogeographer and ecological modeler with a PhD in Plant Ecology and Global Change, a Master in Geographical Information Systems, a Degree in Biology, and quite a bit of experience in applying state-of-the-art quantitative methods to better understand the processes shaping the distribution of biodiversity across space and time.","tags":null,"title":"Blas M.

The greatest increase in leaf-damaging spring frost has occurred in Europe and East Asia, where species are more vulnerable to spring frost than in North America.

This unfolding emergency has prompted the preparation and dissemination of the article “Spread of SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus likely to be constrained by climate” by Araújo and Naimi (2020). The authors present the results of an ensemble forecast made from a suite of species distribution models (SDMs), where they attempt to predict the suitability of the climate for the spread of SARS-CoV-2 over the coming months. They argue that climate is likely to be a primary regulator for the spread of the infection and that people in warm-temperate and cold climates are more vulnerable than those in tropical and arid climates. A central finding of their study is that the possibility of a synchronous global pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 is unlikely. Whilst we understand that the motivations behind producing such work are grounded in trying to be helpful, we demonstrate here that there are clear conceptual and methodological deficiencies with their study that render their results and conclusions invalid.","tags":["Irresponsible Covid19 modelling","Species Distribution Models"],"title":"On the inadequacy of species distribution models for modelling the spread of SARS-CoV-2: response to Araújo and Naimi","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Blas M.

A few months ago I connected it with my two laptops (one of them deceased now, RIP my dear skynet) to create a little cluster to run parallel tasks in R.\nToday I made a home cluster to spread parallel R tasks across all my computers. That was fun! #rstats pic.twitter.com/ic4plvO3Y6\n\u0026mdash; Blas M. Benito (@BlasBenito) April 27, 2020  It was just a draft cluster running on a wireless network, but it served me to think about getting a more permanent solution not requiring two additional laptops in my desk.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s were the nice INTEL NUCs (from Next Unit of Computing) come into play. NUCs are full-fledged computers fitted in small boxes usually sold without RAM memory sticks and no hard disk (hence the term barebone). Since they have a low energy consumption footprint, I thought these would be ideal units for my soon-to-be home cluster.\nMaterial I gifted myself with:\n 2 Intel Barebone BOXNUC6CAYH, each with 4 cores, and a maximum RAM memory of 32GB (you might read they only accept 8GB, but that\u0026rsquo;s not the case anymore). Notice that these NUCs aren\u0026rsquo;t state-of-the-art now, they were released by the end of 2016. 2 Hard disks SSD 2.5\u0026rdquo; Western Digital WDS250G2B0A WD Blue (250GB) 4 Crucial CT102464BF186D DDR3 SODIMM (204 pins) RAM sticks with 8GB each. 1 ethernet switch Netgear GS308-300PES with 8 ports. 3 ethernet wires NanoCable 10.20.0400-BL of cat 6 quality.  The whole set came to cost around 530€, but please notice that I had a clear goal in mind: \u0026ldquo;duplicating\u0026rdquo; my computing power with the minimum number of NUCs, while preserving a share of 4GB of RAM memory per CPU throughout the cluster (based on the features of my desk computer). A more basic setting with more modest NUCs and smaller RAM would cost half of that.\nThis instructive video by David Harry shows how to install the SSD and the RAM sticks in an Intel NUC. It really takes 5 minutes tops, one only has to be a bit careful with the RAM sticks, the pins need to go all the way in into their slots before securing the sticks in place.\n  Network settings Before starting to install an operating system in the NUCS, the network setup goes as follows:\n My desktop PC is connected to a router via WIFI and dynamic IP (DHCP). The PC and each NUC are connected to the switch with cat6 ethernet wires.  To share my PC\u0026rsquo;s WIFI connection with the NUCs I have to prepare a new connection profile with the command line tool of Ubuntu\u0026rsquo;s NetworkManager, named nmcli, as follows.\nFirst, I need to find the name of my ethernet interface by checking the status of my network devices with the command line.\nnmcli device status DEVICE TYPE STATE CONNECTION wlp3s0 wifi connected my_wifi enp2s0 ethernet unavailable -- lo loopback unmanaged --  There I can see that my ethernet interface is named enp2s0.\nSecond, I have to configure the shared connection.\nnmcli connection add type ethernet ifname enp2s0 ipv4.method shared con-name cluster  Were ifname enp2s0 is the name of the interface I want to use for the new connection, ipv4.method shared is the type of connection, and con-name cluster is the name I want the connection to have. This operation adds firewall rules to manage traffic within the cluster network, starts a DHCP server in the computer that serves IPs to the NUCS, and a DNS server that allows the NUCs to translate internet addresses.\nAfter turning on the switch, I can check the connection status again with\nnmcli device status DEVICE TYPE STATE CONNECTION enp2s0 ethernet connected cluster wlp3s0 wifi connected my_wifi lo loopback unmanaged --  When checking the IP of the device with bash ifconfig it should yield 10.42.0.1. Any other computer in the cluster network will have a dynamic IP in the range 10.42.0.1/24.\nFurther details about how to set a shared connection with NetworkManager can be found in this nice post by Beniamino Galvani.\nSSH setup My PC, as the director of the cluster, needs an SSH client running, while the NUCs need an SSH server. SSH (Secure Shell) is a remote authentication protocol that allows secure connections to remote servers that I will be using all the time to manage the cluster. To install, run, and check its status I just have to run these lines in the console:\nsudo apt install ssh sudo systemctl enable --now ssh sudo systemctl status ssh  Now, a secure certificate of the identity of a given computer, named ssh-key, that grants access to remote ssh servers and services needs to be generated.\nssh-keygen \u0026quot;label\u0026quot;  Here, substitute \u0026ldquo;label\u0026rdquo; by the name of the computer to be used as cluster\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;director\u0026rdquo;. The system will ask for a file name and a passphrase that will be used to encrypt the ssh-key.\nThe ssh-key needs to be added to the ssh-agent.\nssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa  To copy the ssh-key to my GitHub account, I have to copy the contents of the file ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub (can be done just opening it with gedit ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub + Ctrl + a + Ctrl + c), and paste it on GitHub account \u0026gt; Settings \u0026gt; SSH and GPG keys \u0026gt; New SSH Key (green button in the upper right part of the window).\nNote: If you don\u0026rsquo;t use GitHub, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to copy your ssh-key to the NUCs once they are up and running with ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub user_name@nuc_IP.\nInstalling and preparing ubuntu server in each NUC The NUCs don\u0026rsquo;t need to waste resources in a user graphical interface I won\u0026rsquo;t be using whatsoever. Since they will work in a headless configuration once the cluster is ready, a Linux distro without graphical user interface such as Ubuntu server is the way to go.\nInstalling Ubuntu server First it is important to connect a display, a keyboard, and a mouse to the NUC in preparation, and turn it on while pushing F2 to start the visual BIOS. These BIOS parameters need to be modified:\n Advanced (upper right) \u0026gt; Boot \u0026gt; Boot Configuration \u0026gt; UEFI Boot \u0026gt; OS Selection: Linux Advanced \u0026gt; Boot \u0026gt; Boot Configuration \u0026gt; UEFI Boot \u0026gt; OS Selection: mark \u0026ldquo;Boot USB Devices First\u0026rdquo;. [optional] Advanced \u0026gt; Power \u0026gt; Secondary Power Settings \u0026gt; After Power Failure: \u0026ldquo;Power On\u0026rdquo;. I have the switch and nucs connected to an outlet plug extender with an interrupter. When I switch it on, the NUCs (and the switch) boot automatically after this option is enabled, so I only need to push one button to power up the cluster. F10 to save, and shutdown.  To prepare the USB boot device with Ubuntu server 20.04 I first download the .iso from here, by choosing \u0026ldquo;Option 3\u0026rdquo;, which leads to the manual install. Once the .iso file is downloaded, I use Ubuntu\u0026rsquo;s Startup Disk Creator to prepare a bootable USB stick. Now I just have to plug the stick in the NUC and reboot it.\nThe Ubuntu server install is pretty straightforward, and only a few things need to be decided along the way:\n As user name I choose the same I have in my personal computer. As name for the NUCs I choose \u0026ldquo;nuc1\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;nuc2\u0026rdquo;, but any other option will work well. As password, for comfort I use the same I have in my personal computer. During the network setup, choose DHCP. If the network is properly configured and the switch is powered on, after a few seconds the NUC will acquire an IP in the range 10.42.0.1/24, as any other machine within the cluster network. When asked, mark the option \u0026ldquo;Install in the whole disk\u0026rdquo;, unless you have other plans for your NUC. Mark \u0026ldquo;Install OpenSSH\u0026rdquo;. Provide it with your GitHub user name if you have your ssh-key there, and it will download it right away, facilitating a lot the ssh setup.  Reboot once the install is completed. Now I keep configuring the NUC\u0026rsquo;s operating system from my PC through ssh.\nConfiguring the NUC First, to learn the IP of the NUC:\nsudo arp-scan 10.42.0.1/24  Other alternatives to this command are arp -a and sudo arp-scan -I enp2s0 --localnet. Once I learn the IP of the NUC, I add it to the file etc/hosts of my personal computer as follows.\nFirst I open the file as root.\nsudo gedit /etc/hosts  Add a new line there: 10.42.0.XXX nuc1 and save the file.\nNow I access the NUC trough ssh to keep preparing it without a keyboard and a display. I do it from Tilix, that allows to open different command line tabs in the same window, which is quite handy to manage several NUCs at once.\nAnother great option to manage the NUCs through ssh would be terminator, that apparently allows to send the same commands to several ssh sessions at once, which sounds incredibly handy.\nssh blas@10.42.0.XXX  The NUC\u0026rsquo;s operating system probably has a bunch of pending software updates. To install these:\nsudo apt-get upgrade  Now I have to install a set of software packages that will facilitate managing the cluster\u0026rsquo;s network and the NUC itself.\nsudo apt install net-tools arp-scan lm-sensors dirmngr gnupg apt-transport-https ca-certificates software-properties-common samba libopenmpi3 libopenmpi-dev openmpi-bin openmpi-common htop  Setting the system time To set the system time of the NUC to the same you have in your computer, just repeat these steps in every computer in the cluster network.\n#list time zones: timedatectl list-timezones #set time zone sudo timedatectl set-timezone Europe/Madrid #enable timesyncd sudo timedatectl set-ntp on  Setting the locale The operating systems of the NUCs and the PC need to have the same locale. It can be set by editing the file /etc/default/locale with either nano (in the NUCS) or gedit (in the PC) and adding these lines, just replacing en_US.UTF-8 with your preferred locale.\nLANG=\u0026quot;en_US.UTF-8\u0026rdquo;\nLANGUAGE=\u0026quot;en_US:en\u0026rdquo;\nLC_NUMERIC=\u0026quot;en_US.UTF-8\u0026rdquo;\nLC_TIME=\u0026quot;en_US.UTF-8\u0026rdquo;\nLC_MONETARY=\u0026quot;en_US.UTF-8\u0026rdquo;\nLC_PAPER=\u0026quot;en_US.UTF-8\u0026rdquo;\nLC_IDENTIFICATION=\u0026quot;en_US.UTF-8\u0026rdquo;\nLC_NAME=\u0026quot;en_US.UTF-8\u0026rdquo;\nLC_ADDRESS=\u0026quot;en_US.UTF-8\u0026rdquo;\nLC_TELEPHONE=\u0026quot;en_US.UTF-8\u0026rdquo;\nLC_MEASUREMENT=\u0026quot;en_US.UTF-8\u0026rdquo;\nTemperature monitoring NUCs are prone to overheating when under heavy loads for prolonged times. Therefore, monitoring the temperature of the NUCs CPUs is kinda important. In a step before I installed lm-sensors in the NUC, which provides the tools to do so. To setup the sensors from an ssh session in the NUC:\nsudo sensors-detect  The program will request permission to find sensors in the NUC. I answered \u0026ldquo;yes\u0026rdquo; to every request. Once all sensors are identified, to check them\nsensors iwlwifi_1-virtual-0 Adapter: Virtual device temp1: N/A acpitz-acpi-0 Adapter: ACPI interface temp1: +32.0°C (crit = +100.0°C) coretemp-isa-0000 Adapter: ISA adapter Package id 0: +30.0°C (high = +105.0°C, crit = +105.0°C) Core 0: +30.0°C (high = +105.0°C, crit = +105.0°C) Core 1: +30.0°C (high = +105.0°C, crit = +105.0°C) Core 2: +29.0°C (high = +105.0°C, crit = +105.0°C) Core 3: +30.0°C (high = +105.0°C, crit = +105.0°C)  which gives the cpu temperatures at the moment the command was executed. The command watch sensors gives continuous temperature readings instead.\nTo control overheating in my NUCs I removed their top lids, and installed them into a custom LEGO \u0026ldquo;rack\u0026rdquo; with external USB fans with velocity control, as shown in the picture at the beginning of the post.\nInstalling R To install R in the NUCs I just proceed as I would when installing it in my personal computer. There is a thorough guide here.\nIn a step above I installed all the pre-required software packages. Now I only have to add the security key of the R repository, add the repository itself, update the information on the packages available in the new repository, and finally install R.\nsudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys E298A3A825C0D65DFD57CBB651716619E084DAB9 sudo add-apt-repository 'deb https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu focal-cran40/' sudo apt update sudo apt install r-base  Note: If R has issues to recognize the system locale\nnano ~/.profile  add the following lines, replacing en_US.UTF-8 with your preferred locale\nexport LANG=en_US.UTF-8 export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8\nsave, and execute the file to export the locale so R can read it.\n. ~/.profile  Finalizing the network configuration Each NUC needs firewall rules to grant access from other computers withinn the cluster network. To activate the NUC\u0026rsquo;s firewall and check what ports are open:\nsudo ufw enable sudo ufw status  To grant access from the PC to the NUC through ssh, and later through R for parallel computing, the ports 22 and 11000 must be open for the IP of the PC (10.42.0.1).\nsudo ufw allow ssh sudo ufw allow from 10.42.0.1 to any port 11000 sudo ufw allow from 10.42.0.1 to any port 22  Finally, the other members of the cluster network must be declared in the /etc/hosts file of each computer.\nIn each NUC edit the file through ssh with bash sudo nano /etc/hosts and add the lines\n10.42.0.1 pc_name\n10.42.0.XXX name_of_the_other_nuc\nIn the PC, add the lines\n10.42.0.XXX name_of_one_nuc\n10.42.0.XXX name_of_the_other_nuc\nAt this point, after rebooting every machine, the NUCs must be accessible through ssh by using their names (ssh username@nuc_name) instead of their IPs (ssh username@n10.42.0.XXX). Just take in mind that, since the cluster network works with dynamic IPs (and such setting cannot be changed in a shared connection), the IPs of the NUCs might change if a new device is added to the network. That\u0026rsquo;s something you need to check from the PC with sudo arp-scan 10.42.0.1/24, to update every /etc/hosts file accordingly.\nI think that\u0026rsquo;s all folks. Good luck setting your home cluster!

We tested this hypothesis using experiments in 215 species and leaf‐out monitoring in 1585 species from East Asia (EA), Europe (EU) and North America (NA). The results reveal that species from regions with high STV indeed have higher winter chilling requirements, and, when grown under the same conditions, leaf out later than related species from regions with lower STV. Since 1900, STV has been consistently higher in NA than in EU and EA, and under experimentally short winter conditions NA species required 84% more spring warming for bud break, EU ones 49% and EA ones only 1%.
