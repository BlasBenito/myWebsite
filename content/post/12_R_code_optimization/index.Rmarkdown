## Summary

Optimizing code isn't just about speed, it’s about writing *efficient* code. Efficient for the developer (you, maybe?), and efficient for the machine running it. 

Drawing from my experience handling large, complex datasets and pipelines in academia and industry, here I share practical techniques and tools that can help you streamline your R workflows without sacrificing clarity. Whether you're optimizing for speed, memory efficiency, or reproducibility, this guide should provide a solid foundation for improving your code in ways that are both effective and sustainable.

If you're looking to make your R code both faster and more maintainable, this guide is for you.

## Understanding Code Efficiency

When working with large datasets or complex machine learning models, performance bottlenecks can drain both time and money. That’s where **code optimization** steps in to either save the day or make things worse.

For data scientists and researchers, optimization isn’t just about raw speed; it’s about making workflows more efficient, whatever that means for you. 

The diagram below illustrates the hierarchy of elements defining code efficiency. The orange boxes highlight modifiable code components, while the green boxes indicate measurable performance dimensions and emergent performance properties.

Software exists for us developers and users, and our time is far more valuable than CPU time! That's why **code simplicity** sits at the top of the hierarchy of elements defining code efficiency. The best way to improve efficiency? **Make your code simple!** Simplicity means writing readable, modular, and easy-to-use code. However, striking a balance between readability and optimization is key: over-optimization can make code unreadable, while excessive simplicity might leave major performance gains on the table.

Beneath simplicity, **algorithm design** and **data structures** form the core of code efficiency. Well-designed algorithms and appropriate data structures contribute the most to performance in most cases. However, the **programming language** also plays a crucial role. An efficient algorithm implemented in C++ may vastly outperform the same algorithm written in R due to differences in compilation, memory management, and execution models.

Next, **hardware utilization** determines how well algorithms and data structures leverage computational resources. Techniques like *vectorization*, *parallelization*, *GPU acceleration*, and *memory management* can dramatically increase performance and improve efficiency.

These foundational choices impact three key performance dimensions:

  - **Execution Speed** (Time Complexity): The time required to run the code.
  - **Memory Usage** (Space Complexity): Peak RAM consumption during execution.
  - **Input/Output Efficiency**: How well the code handles file access, network usage, and database queries.

At a higher level, two emergent properties arise:

  - **Scalability**: How well the code adapts to increasing workloads and larger infrastructures.
  - **Energy Efficiency**: The trade-off between computational cost and energy consumption.

Code optimization is a multidimensional trade-off. Improving one aspect often affects others. For example, speeding up execution might increase memory usage, parallelization can create I/O bottlenecks, and refactoring for performance may reduce readability. There’s rarely a single "best" solution, only trade-offs based on context and constraints.

## To Optimize Or Not To Optimize, That Is The Question

If for some reason you find yourself in the conundrum expressed in the title of this section, then you might find solace in the *First Commandment of Code Optimization*.

> "Thou shall not optimize thy code."  
> — A Lazy God

Also known in some circles as the *[YOLO](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/yolo) Principle*, this commandment reveals the righteous path! If your code **is reasonably simple and works as expected**, you can call it a day and move on, because there is no reason whatsoever to attempt any optimization. This idea aligns well with a principle enunciated long ago:

> "Premature optimization is the root of all evil."  
> — [Donald Knuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth) - [*The Art of Computer Programming*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_Computer_Programming)

*Premature optimization* happens when we let performance considerations get in the way of our code design. Designing code is a taxing task already, and designing code while trying to make it efficient at once is even harder! Having a non-trivial fraction of our mental bandwidth focused on optimization results in code more complex than it should be, and increases the chance of introducing bugs.

That said, there are legitimate reasons to break the first commandment. Maybe you are bold enough to publish your code in a paper (Reviewer #2 says *hi*), releasing it as package for the community, or simply sharing it with your data team. In these cases, the *Second Commandment* comes into play.

> "Thou shall make thy code simple."  
> — A Simple God

Optimizing code for simplicity isn't just about aesthetics; it's about making it readable, maintainable, and easy to use and debug. In essence, this commandment ensures that we optimize the time required to interact with the code. Any code that saves the time of users and maintainers is efficient enough already! 

At this point we have a clean and elegant code that runs once and gets the job done, great! But what if it must run thousands of times in production? Or worse, what if a single execution takes hours or even days? In these cases, optimization shifts from a nice-to-have to a requirement. Yep, there's a commandment for this too.

> "Thou shall optimize wisely." 
> — A Simple God

At this point you might be at the ready, fingers on the keyboard, about to deface your pretty code for the sake of sheer performance. Just don't. This is a great point to stop, go back to the whiteboard, and think *carefully* about what you ~~want~~ need to do. You gotta be smart about your next steps! 

There are three principles to think about while planning code optimization.

The first one is the [Pareto Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle):

> "Roughly 80% of the consequences result from 20% of the causes." 
> — A Simple God

Pareto Principle has been widely applied in the context of software development and code optimization, often in the form of "80% of the execution time is spent in 20% of the code." This idea is echoed by many modern software engineers and performance experts, emphasizing that focusing optimization efforts on the most critical 20% of the code (often the bottlenecks) yields the most significant performance improvements.

A modern paraphrase might go like this:

"In software development, 80% of your program's performance issues come from 20% of your code. Identifying and optimizing that 20% is key to achieving the best performance improvements."

While there's no single well-known quote that originated the idea in the specific context of code optimization, it is widely recognized in the development community. It’s often referenced in the context of profiling and identifying performance bottlenecks using tools like profilers or benchmarks.

It captures the essence of Pareto’s principle: the idea that a small portion of the system or effort is responsible for most of the outcome (in this case, the performance).


most of our code performance issues (80 to 90 percent) result from a small fraction of the code (20 to 10 percent). Then, identifying and analyzing. 

  - Beware over-optimization:  happens when we keep pushing for marginal performance gains at the expense of clarity. It often results in convoluted one-liners and obscure tricks to save milliseconds that will confuse future you while making your code harder to maintain.



Beyond these important points, there is no golden rule to follow here. Optimize when needed, and do it in ways that preserve clarity to set yourself for success.

## The Optimization Loop

Optimizing R code isn’t a one-time task—it’s an iterative process. The best way to balance performance and maintainability is to follow a structured approach:
1. Start with Clean Design

Before thinking about optimization, focus entirely on writing clear, well-structured code. This means:

    Choosing the best algorithm and most appropriate data structures for the problem.
    Writing modular, easy-to-read functions with meaningful names.
    Avoiding unnecessary complexity—clarity trumps cleverness.
    
This post is not focused on code simplicity, but here are a few key principles that might be helpful:

  - **Use a consistent style**: Stick to a recognizable style guide, such as the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) or [Google’s R style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.html).
  
  - **Avoid deep nesting**: Excessive nesting makes code harder to read and debug. This wonderful video makes the point quite clear: [Why You Shouldn't Nest Your Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CFRhGnuXG-4).
  
  - **Use meaningful names**: Clear names for functions, arguments, and variables make the code self-explanatory! Avoid cryptic abbreviations or single-letter names and do not hesitate to use long and descriptive names. The video [Naming Things in Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J3wNP6u5YU) is a great resource on this topic.
  
  - **Limit number of function arguments**: According to [Uncle Bob Martin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._Martin), author of the book ["Clean Code"](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/clean-code-a/9780136083238/), *the ideal number of arguments for a function is zero*. There's no need to be that extreme, but it is important to acknowledge that the user's cognitive load increases with the number of arguments. If a function has more than five args you can either rethink your approach or let the user pay the check.
  
Beyond these tips, I highly recommend the book [A Philosophy of Software Design](https://www.amazon.com/dp/173210221X), by [John Ousterhout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ousterhout). It helped me find new ways to write better code!

At this stage, don’t worry about performance at all. A well-designed foundation will naturally lead to better efficiency later.
2. Measure Performance (Profile Your Code!)

Instead of guessing where bottlenecks might be, use profiling tools to identify the actual slow parts of your code:

    Use profvis::profvis() or Rprof() for detailed profiling.
    For quick benchmarking, use bench::mark() or microbenchmark::microbenchmark().
    Log memory usage with lobstr::mem_used() if memory is a concern.

This step helps you find real inefficiencies, so you don’t waste time optimizing parts of the code that aren’t problematic.
3. Optimize the Low-Hanging Fruit

Once you know where the real slowdowns are, optimize only the parts that provide significant gains without compromising clarity. Some common low-hanging fruit:

    Eliminate unnecessary computations (e.g., avoid redundant loops, reuse calculations).
    Refactor bottleneck functions (e.g., replace slow operations with built-in vectorized alternatives).
    Simplify data handling (e.g., use appropriate data types, avoid excessive copies of large objects).

Avoid over-optimizing too early—focus only on fixes that are clear, easy to implement, and make a measurable difference.
4. Iterate Until Satisfied

After each round of optimization, re-profile your code and check if further improvements are needed. If performance is now acceptable, stop optimizing. If not, repeat the process:

    Profile again.
    Identify new bottlenecks.
    Optimize only where necessary.
    Repeat until additional optimization no longer justifies the cost in complexity.

The Golden Rule: Stop When It’s “Good Enough”

Optimization should be goal-driven, not an endless pursuit of perfection. If your code is fast enough for its intended use case, further optimization is unnecessary—especially if it would reduce readability or maintainability.

By following this loop, you ensure that your R code remains clean, efficient, and easy to maintain while optimizing only when it truly matters.
