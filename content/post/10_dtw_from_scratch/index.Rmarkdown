# Summary

This post walks you through the implementation of a minimalistic yet fully functional [Dynamic Time Warping](https://www.blasbenito.com/post/dynamic-time-warping/) (DTW) library in R, built entirely from scratch without dependencies or complex abstractions. While there are many [open-source DTW implementations](https://blasbenito.github.io/distantia/articles/dtw_applications.html) readily available, understanding the inner workings of the algorithm can be invaluable. Whether youâ€™re simply curious or need a deeper grasp of DTW for your projects, this step-by-step guide offers a hands-on approach to demystify the method.

# Design

## Example Data

Having good example data at hand is a must when developing new code. For this tutorial we use a subset of three multivariate time series of temperature, rainfall, and normalized vegetation index available in the R package [distantia](https://blasbenito.github.io/distantia/).

```{r, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(distantia, quietly = TRUE)
library(zoo, quietly = TRUE)

tsl <- tsl_initialize(
  x = fagus_dynamics,
  name_column = "name",
  time_column = "time"
) |> 
  tsl_subset(
    names = c("Spain", "Sweden"),
    time = c("2010-01-01", "2011-01-01")
  ) |> 
  tsl_colnames_set(
    names = c("evi", "rain", "temp")
  )

tsl_plot(tsl, text_cex = 1.5)
```

To facilitate our development, each time series is stored in an object of the class [zoo](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=zoo), which is probably the most flexible time series management library in the R ecosystem.

```{r}
zoo_sweden <- tsl$Sweden
zoo_spain <- tsl$Spain

class(zoo_sweden)
```

Each zoo object has a *core data* of the class "matrix" with one observation per row and one variable per column, and an *index*, which is a vector of dates, one per row in the data matrix.

```{r}
zoo::coredata(zoo_sweden)
```

```{r}
class(zoo::coredata(zoo_sweden))
```

## Required Functions

The section *DTW Step by Step* from the previous article [A Gentle Intro to Dynamic Time Warping](https://www.blasbenito.com/post/dynamic-time-warping/) shows the steps required to compute DTW. Below, these steps are broken down in sub-steps that will correspond to specific functionalities in our library:

**Pre-processing steps** 

These steps help DTW work as best as possible with the input data.

  - **Linear detrending**: forces time series to be stationary by removing any upwards or downwards trends. 
  - **Z-score normalization**: facilitates distance computation between samples multivariate time series and limits potential alignment issues in DTW.

**DTW steps**

Steps to perform DTW proper and evaluate the similarity between time series.

  - **Multivariate distance**: evaluate the distance between samples of each time series.
  - **Distance matrix**: organize the multivariate distances in a matrix.
  - **Cost matrix**: dynamic programming algorithm to accumulate distance across time.
  - **Least-cost path**: algorithm to find the path across the cost matrix that maximizes the alignment between both time series.
  - **Dissimilarity metric**: computation of a number to summarize the similarity/dissimilarity between time series.
  
**Main function**

Once all the steps above are implemented in their respective functions, we will wrap all them in a single function to streamline the DTW analysis.
  
# Implementation

In this section we will be developing the library function by function. Remember that the content of each code chunk should be added to the file `mini_dtw.R`.
    
### Linear Detrending

Applying linear detrending to a time series involves computing a linear model of each variable against time, and subtracting the result of the model prediction to the original data. This operation can be done in just two steps for a zoo object. 

First, the function `stats::lm()` can be applied to all variables in our time series at once

```{r}
model_sweden <- stats::lm(
  formula = zoo_sweden ~ stats::time(zoo_sweden)
  )

model_sweden
```

Second, the residuals of the linear model represent the differences between the prediction and the observed data, which corresponds exactly with the detrended time series. As a plus, these residuals are returned as a zoo object.

```{r}
zoo_sweden_detrended <- stats::residuals(model_sweden)
zoo_sweden_detrended

plot(
  x = zoo_sweden_detrended, 
  col = "red4",
  mar = c(0.5, 5, 0, 5)
  )
```

Then, the first function of our library could be something like this:

```{r}
#' Linear Detrending
#' @param x (required, zoo object) time series to detrend.
#' @return zoo object
ts_detrend <- function(x){
  m <- stats::lm(formula = x ~ stats::time(x))
  y <- stats::residuals(object = m)
  y
}
```

Notice that it could be more concise, but it is written to facilitate line-by-line debugging instead. I have also added minimal roxygen documentation. Future me usually appreciates this kind of extra effort.

We can now test the new function!

```{r}
zoo_spain_detrended <- ts_detrend(x = zoo_spain)

plot(
  x = zoo_spain_detrended, 
  col = "red4",
  mar = c(0.5, 5, 0, 5)
  )
```

The effect of our new function is not very noticeable because none of our time series have long-term trends, but let's try something different to check that our function actually detrends time series.

The code below creates a mock-up time series with an ascending trend.

```{r, fig.height=3}
x <- zoo::zoo(0:10)

plot(
  x = x, 
  col = "red4",
  mar = c(0.5, 1, 0, 1)
  )
```

The detrending operation results in a horizontal line! Now we can be sure our detrending function works as expected.

```{r, fig.height=3}
x_detrended <- ts_detrend(x = x)

plot(
  x = x_detrended, 
  col = "red4",
  ylim = range(x),
  mar = c(0.5, 5, 0, 5)
  )
```


### Z-score Normalization

The function `scale()`, from base R, already implements z-score normalization. When the library `zoo` is loaded, the method `zoo:::scale.zoo` (`:::` denotes unexported methods and functions) allows `scale()` to work seamlessly with zoo objects.

```{r}
zoo_spain_scaled <- scale(
  x = zoo_spain,
  center = TRUE,
  scale = TRUE
  )

zoo_spain_scaled
```

```{r}
class(zoo_spain_scaled)
```

Centering is performed by subtracting the column mean to each case, and results in a column mean equal to zero. Scaling divides each case by the standard deviation of the column, resulting in an overall standard deviation across cases equal to one.

This normalization step does not require a function in our library, but we can add it to our function `ts_detrend()` to encapsulate all pre-processing steps into a new function named `ts_preprocessing()`.

```{r}
#' Linear Detrending and Normalization
#' @param x (required, zoo object) time series to detrend.
#' @return zoo object
ts_preprocessing <- function(x){
  m <- stats::lm(formula = x ~ stats::time(x))
  y <- stats::residuals(object = m) |> 
    scale()
  y
}
```

Once we replace the old function with the new one, we can source the library and test it.

```{r}
zoo_spain_ready <- ts_preprocessing(x = zoo_spain)

plot(
  x = zoo_spain_ready, 
  col = "red4",
  mar = c(0.5, 5, 0, 5)
  )
```

### Distance Matrix

The computation of a distance matrix first requires a function to compute the multivariate distance between two arbitrary rows of separate zoo objects with the same number of columns.

#### Distance Function

The expression to compute Euclidean distances between two vectors `x` and `y` representing the rows of zoo objects is `sqrt(sum((x-y)^2))`. The function below implements this expression:

```{r}
#' Euclidean Distance
#' @param x (required, numeric) row of a zoo object.  
#' @param y (required, numeric) row of a zoo object.
#' @return numeric
d_euclidean <- function(x, y){
  sqrt(sum((x - y)^2))
}
```

Implementing such a simple expression in a function is not a must, but it may facilitate the addition of new distance metrics to the library in the future.

We can test it right away, and let's ignore for now that none of our zoo objects are normalized yet.

```{r}
d_euclidean(
  x = zoo::coredata(zoo_sweden)[1, ],
  y = zoo::coredata(zoo_spain)[2, ]
)
```

Notice that I am using `zoo::coredata()` to extract the individual rows of each zoo object. Without this step, goofy things happen:

```{r}
d_euclidean(
  x = zoo_sweden[1, ],
  y = zoo_spain[2, ]
)
```

We can also solve this quirk by using `as.numeric()` instead of `zoo::coredata()`:

```{r}
d_euclidean(
  x = as.numeric(zoo_sweden[1, ]),
  y = as.numeric(zoo_spain[2, ])
)
```

Then, moving these `as.numeric()` inside `d_euclidean()` will be helpful to simplify the usage of the function:

```{r}
#' Euclidean Distance
#' @param x (required, numeric) row of a zoo object.  
#' @param y (required, numeric) row of a zoo object.
#' @return numeric
d_euclidean <- function(x, y){
  sqrt(
    sum((as.numeric(x) - as.numeric(y))^2)
    )
}
```
The test below shows how it works.

```{r}

d_euclidean(
  x = zoo_sweden[1, ],
  y = zoo_spain[2, ]
)
```


#### Distance Matrix

To generate the distance matrix, the new function must be applied to all pairs of rows in two zoo objects. A simple yet inefficient way to do this involves creating an empty matrix, and traversing it cell by cell to compute the euclidean distances between the corresponding pair of rows in each time series.

```{r}
#empty distance matrix
m_dist <- matrix(
  data = NA, 
  nrow = nrow(zoo_spain), 
  ncol = nrow(zoo_sweden)
)

#iterate over rows
for(row in 1:nrow(zoo_spain)){
  
  #iterate over columns
  for(col in 1:nrow(zoo_sweden)){
    
    #distance between time series rows
    m_dist[row, col] <- d_euclidean(
      x = zoo_spain[row, ],
      y = zoo_sweden[col, ]
    )
    
  }
}
```

This code generates a matrix in which the samples of `zoo_spain` are represented in the matrix rows from top to bottom, while `zoo_sweden` is represented in the columns, from left to right.

```{r}
m_dist[1:5, 1:5]
```

Now we can plot this distance matrix, but notice that the function `graphics::image()` rotates the distance matrix 90 degrees counter clock-wise before plotting, which can be pretty confusing at first.

```{r}
par(mar = c(4, 4, 1, 1))
graphics::image(
  x = seq_len(ncol(m_dist)),
  y = seq_len(nrow(m_dist)),
  z = m_dist,
  xlab = "zoo_spain",
  ylab = "zoo_sweden"
  )
```

The first column in the plot represents the first row of our original matrix `m_dist`.

We can now wrap the code above (without the plot) in a new function named `distance_matrix()`.

```{r}
#' Distance Matrix Between Time Series
#' @param x (required, zoo object) time series.
#' @param y (required, zoo object) time series with same columns as `x`
#' @return matrix
distance_matrix <- function(x, y){
  
  m <- matrix(
    data = NA, 
    nrow = nrow(y), 
    ncol = nrow(x)
  )
  
  for(row in 1:nrow(y)){
    for(col in 1:nrow(x)){
      
      m[row, col] <- d_euclidean(
        x = x[row, ],
        y = y[col, ]
      )
      
    }
  }
  
  m
  
}
```

Let's run a little test before moving forward!

```{r}
m_dist <- distance_matrix(
  x = zoo_spain,
  y = zoo_sweden
)

par(mar = c(4, 4, 1, 1))
graphics::image(
  x = seq_len(ncol(m_dist)),
  y = seq_len(nrow(m_dist)),
  z = m_dist,
  xlab = "zoo_sweden",
  ylab = "zoo_spain"
  )
```

Darker values in the plot above indicate larger distances between time series samples.

### Cost Matrix

Now we are getting into the important parts of the DTW algorithm! 

A cost matrix is like a valley's landscape with hills in regions where the time series are very different, and ravines where they are more similar.

Such landscape is built by accumulating the values of the distance matrix cell by cell from [1, 1] at the bottom of the valley to [m, n] at the top.

Let's see how that works:

First, we use the dimensions of the distance matrix to create an empty cost matrix.

```{r, warning = FALSE}
m_cost <- matrix(
  data = NA, 
  nrow = nrow(m_dist), 
  ncol = ncol(m_dist)
  )
```

Second, to initialize the cost matrix we accumulate the values of first row and column of the distance matrix using `cumsum()`:

```{r}
m_cost[1, ] <- cumsum(m_dist[1, ])
m_cost[, 1] <- cumsum(m_dist[, 1])
```

This step is very important for the second part of the algorithm, as it provides the starting values.

```{r}
par(mar = c(4, 4, 1, 1))
graphics::image(
  x = seq_len(ncol(m_cost)),
  y = seq_len(nrow(m_cost)),
  z = m_cost,
  xlab = "zoo_sweden",
  ylab = "zoo_spain"
  )
```

As before, darker values in the plot above indicate larger cumulative distances.

Now, before going into the third step, let's focus for a moment on the next cell of the cost matrix we need to fill. This cell, with coordinates `m_cost[2, 2]`, shown with value `NA` below.

```{r}
m_cost[1:2, 1:2]
```

The new value of this cell must be the sum of its value in the distance matrix `m_dist`, which is `r m_dist[2, 2]`, with the minimum accumulated distance of its neighbors, which are `m_cost[1, 2]`, with value `r m_cost[1, 2]`, and `m_cost[2, 1]`, with value `r m_cost[2, 1]`. 

In summary, we have two alternative steps: sum the distance in the empty cell with the cost of the upper neighbor, or with the left one, and we have to choose the one that minimizes the value of the result.

This conundrum is easily solved with the expression below, which uses `min()` to get the value of the *smallest* neighbor, and then adds it to the target cell

```{r}
m_cost[2, 2] <- min(
  m_cost[1, 2], 
  m_cost[2, 1]
  ) + m_dist[2, 2]

m_cost[1:2, 1:2]
```

But there are many cells to fill yet!

```{r}
par(mar = c(4, 4, 1, 1))
graphics::image(
  x = seq_len(ncol(m_cost)),
  y = seq_len(nrow(m_cost)),
  z = m_cost,
  xlab = "zoo_sweden",
  ylab = "zoo_spain"
  )
```

The expression we used to fill the cell `m_cost[2, 2]` can be generalized to fill all empty cells. We just have to wrap it in a nested loop that for each new empty cell identifies the smallest neighbor and adds its cost to the distance of new cell.

```{r}
#iterate over rows of the cost matrix
for(row.i in 2:nrow(m_dist)){
  
  #iterate over columns of the cost matrix
  for(col.j in 2:ncol(m_dist)){
    
    #get cost of neighbor with minimum accumulated cost
    min_cost <- min(
      m_cost[row.i - 1, col.j], 
      m_cost[row.i, col.j - 1]
      )
    
    #add it to the distance of the target cell
    new_value <- min_cost + m_dist[row.i, col.j]
    
    #fill the empty cell with the new value
    m_cost[row.i, col.j] <- new_value
    
  }
}
```

Running the code above results in a nicely filled cost matrix!

```{r}
par(mar = c(4, 4, 1, 1))
graphics::image(
  x = seq_len(ncol(m_cost)),
  y = seq_len(nrow(m_cost)),
  z = m_cost,
  xlab = "zoo_sweden",
  ylab = "zoo_spain"
  )
```

Still, there is one more step left! For a reason that will remain unclear until the next section, the terminal cell `m_cost[m, n]` of the cost matrix must have a higher value than any its immediate neighbors. If we look at the lower left corner of our cost matrix, this is not the case yet.

```{r}
m <- nrow(m_cost)
n <- ncol(m_cost)
m_cost[(m-1):m, (n-1):n]
```

To fix this issue, it is customary to sum the cost of the first cell of the cost matrix, `m_cost[1, 1]`, to the last one `m_cost[m, n]`.

```{r}
m_cost[m, n] <- m_cost[m, n] + m_cost[1, 1]

m_cost[(m-1):m, (n-1):n]
```

Now that we have all the pieces together, we can define our new function to compute the cost matrix. Notice that the code within the nested loops is slightly more concise.

```{r}
#' Cost Matrix from Distance Matrix
#' @param m (required, matrix) distance matrix.
#' @return matrix
cost_matrix <- function(m){
  
  m_cost <- matrix(
    data = NA, 
    nrow = nrow(m), 
    ncol = ncol(m)
  )
  
  m_cost[1, ] <- cumsum(m[1, ])
  m_cost[, 1] <- cumsum(m[, 1])
  
  for(row.i in 2:nrow(m)){
    for(col.j in 2:ncol(m)){
      
      m_cost[row.i, col.j] <- min(
        m_cost[row.i - 1, col.j], 
        m_cost[row.i, col.j - 1]
      ) + m[row.i, col.j]
      
    }
  }
  
  m_cost[row.i, col.j] <- m_cost[row.i, col.j] + m_cost[1, 1]
  
  m_cost
  
}
```

Let's test our new function using `m_dist` as input!

```{r}
m_cost <- cost_matrix(m = m_dist)

par(mar = c(4, 4, 1, 1))
graphics::image(
  x = seq_len(ncol(m_cost)),
  y = seq_len(nrow(m_cost)),
  z = m_cost,
  xlab = "zoo_sweden",
  ylab = "zoo_spain"
  )
```

Yay, so far so good! We can now move onto the last step of the DTW algorithm.

### Least-Cost Path

If we describe the cost matrix as a valley with its hills and ravines, then the least-cost path is the river flowing all its way to the bottom. Just like a river, a least-cost path crosses the cost matrix from the last cell `[m, n]` to the first one `[1, 1]` following the line of maximum slope.

To find the least-cost path within our cost matrix we first define a data frame with the coordinates of the last cell `[m, n]`.

```{r}
path <- data.frame(
  row = ncol(m_cost),
  col = nrow(m_cost)
)

path
```

This is the first step of the least cost path. Now, there are two alternative new steps to consider:

  - *one column left*: `[row, col - 1]`.
  - *one row up*: `[row - 1, col]`.
  
But before moving forward, notice that if we apply these steps indefinitely in our cost matrix, at some point a move up `row - 1` or left `col - 1` will go out of bounds and produce an error. That's why it's safer to define the next move as...

  - *one column left*: `[row, max(col - 1, 1)]`.
  - *one row up*: `[max(row - 1, 1), col]`


...which confines them within the first row and column of the cost matrix. 

With that out of the way, now we have to select the move towards a cell with a lower cost. There are many ways to accomplish this task! Let's look at the option below.

First, we define the candidate moves using the first row of the least cost path as reference.

```{r}
steps <- list(
  left = c(path$row, max(path$col - 1, 1)),
  up = c(max(path$row - 1, 1), path$col)
)

steps
```
Notice that the function returns a list with the coordinates of the candidate moves. The move `left` is one column to the left (second number is 12 instead of 13), and the move `up` is one row above the original row of the first step.

Second, we need to extract the values of the cost matrix for the coordinates of these two steps to have a selection criteria.

```{r}
costs <- list(
  left = m_cost[steps$left[1], steps$left[2]],
  up = m_cost[steps$up[1], steps$up[2]]
)

costs
```

Finally, we choose the candidate step with the lower cost using `which.min()`, a function that returns the index of the smallest value in a vector or list. Notice that we use `[1]` to resolve potential ties returned by `which.min()`.

```{r}
steps[[which.min(costs)[1]]]
```

Combining these pieces we can now build a function named `next_step()` that takes the cost matrix and the last row of a least cost path, and returns a new row with the coordinates of the next step.
  
```{r}
#' Identify Next Step of Least-Cost Path
#' @param m cost matrix.
#' @param step one row data frame with columns "row" and "col"
#' @return one row data frame
next_step <- function(m, step){
  
  steps <- list(
    left = c(step$row, max(step$col - 1, 1)),
    up = c(max(step$row - 1, 1), step$col)
  )
  
  costs <- list(
    left = m[steps$left[1], steps$left[2]],
    up = m[steps$up[1], steps$up[2]]
  )
  
  coords <- steps[[which.min(costs)[1]]]
  
  #rewrite input with new values
  step[,] <- c(coords[1], coords[2])
  
  step
  
}
```

Notice that the function overwrites the input data frame `step` with the new values. Let's test it with the data we have at hand!

```{r}
next_step(
  m = m_cost, 
  step = path
  )
```

Good! It returned the move to the left. Now, if you think about the function for a bit, you'll see that it takes the data frame defining the previous step of the least-cost path, and returns a new step. From there, it seems we can feed it its own result again and again until it runs of steps to find!

We can do that in a concise way using a `repeat()` loop. We keep it running until both values in the last row of the path are 1.

```{r}
repeat{
  
  #find next step
  new.step <- next_step(
    m = m_cost, 
    step = tail(path, n = 1)
    )
  
  #join the new step with path
  path <- rbind(
    path, new.step,
    make.row.names = FALSE
    )
  
  #stop when coordinates are 1, 1
  if(all(tail(path, n = 1) == 1)){break}
  
}

path
```
  
We can now plot the resulting least-cost path on top of our cost matrix.

```{r}
par(mar = c(4, 4, 1, 1))
graphics::image(
    x = seq_len(ncol(m_cost)),
    y = seq_len(nrow(m_cost)),
    z = m_cost,
    xlab = "zoo_sweden",
    ylab = "zoo_spain"
    )

graphics::lines(
  x = path$row, 
  y = path$col
  )
```



### Dissimilarity Metric



## Library Source

Our library will *live* in a file named `mini_dtw.R`. We will be adding new R functions to this file as we progress with the implementation. Remember typing `source("mini_dtw.R")` everytime you add new code to this file to make the functions available in your R environment!
