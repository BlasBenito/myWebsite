## Summary

Optimizing code isn't just about speed, it’s about writing *efficient* code. Efficient for the developer (you, maybe?), and efficient for the machine running it. 

Drawing from my experience handling large, complex datasets and pipelines in academia and industry, here I share practical techniques and tools that can help you streamline your R workflows without sacrificing clarity. Whether you're optimizing for speed, memory efficiency, or reproducibility, this guide should provide a solid foundation for improving your code in ways that are both effective and sustainable.

If you're looking to make your R code both faster and more maintainable, this guide is for you.

## Understanding Code Efficiency

When you're working with large data or complex machine learning models, performance bottlenecks can quickly turn into time sinks and money pits. That's when **code optimization** says "hi" and comes to save (or ruin) your day.

As data scientists and researchers, optimizing code isn't just a matter of improving raw speed, it's about making our workflows more **efficient**, whatever that means for you. 

The diagram below shows the hierarchy of elements defining code efficiency. The orange boxes highlight elements of the code that can be modified to improve performance, while the green boxes indicate performance dimensions and emergent properties.

Software exists for us developers and users, and our time is far more valuable than CPU time! That's why **code simplicity** sits at the top of the hierarchy of elements defining code efficiency. To make code more efficient, **make it simple**! Simplicity means writing code that is readable, modular, and easy to use, avoiding unnecessary complexity in the pursuit of efficiency. Simplicity balances raw performance with long-term *usability* and *maintainability*. A small performance gain is rarely worth the cost of making code harder to use, maintain or debug. But striving for both readability and performance requires a careful consideration: over-optimization can lead to code that’s hard to follow, whereas overly simplistic code may leave performance gains off the table.

The two next fundamental elements of code efficiency are **algorithm design** and **data structures**. A careful but balanced design of the computational core of your code and an appropriate selection of the data structures it relies on are largest contributors to code efficiency in most cases. However, the choice of **programming language** also plays a crucial role. An efficient algorithm implemented in C++ may vastly outperform the same algorithm written in R, simply due to differences in compilation, memory management, and execution models.

Building on this foundation, **hardware utilization** describes how algorithm and data structures leverage the available computational resources on an actual machine. At this stage, the combined application of methods such as *vectorization*, *parallelization*, *GPU usage*, and *garbage collection* or other memory management techniques can help multiply code performance.

The interplay between algorithm design, data structures, and hardware utilization determines overall performance, which at its lowest level can be measured across three key dimensions:

  - **Execution Speed**: also known as *Time Complexity*, represents the time required by the computer to run the code.
  - **Memory Usage**: a.k.a *Space Complexity*, represents the peak usage of Random Access Memory during execution.
  - **Input/Output Efficiency**: Describes how efficiently data is moved via file access, network usage, and database queries.

At an even higher level lie two emergent properties: **scalability** and **energy efficiency**. The former refers to how well the code can leverage larger computational infrastructures to handle increasing workloads, while the latter refers to the cost-benefit relationship between the code output and its energy consumption.

Code efficiency is a multidimensional trade-off space where optimizing one dimension often impacts others. A few typical instances are: a modification to speed up execution that ends increasing memory usage and limiting scalability; a parallelization setup that should increase time efficiency but creates an I/O bottleneck instead; a code refactoring to increase performance that reduces readability. There’s rarely a single "best" solution when increasing code efficiency, just different trade-offs depending on the context and constraints.

## To Optimize Or Not To Optimize, That Is The Question

> "Thou shall not optimize thy code."

The first commandment of code optimization is **thou shall not optimize thy code**. And this is a good approach in many cases! If your code is reasonably simple and works as expected, then any optimization effort comes with zero net gain and results in a waste of your precious time on this Earth.

But of course, there are reasons to ignore the commandment above
There are a few reasons to ignore the first commandment though: you are going to share your code with your community (your fellow researchers, your data team, etcetera)
