I'm a senior data scientist & team lead with 19+ years of international experience bridging cutting-edge research and production systems. I build geospatial and machine learning pipelines into scalable solutions to solve hard problems and drive business impact.

## Current Role

I lead data science teams building production systems at the intersection of geospatial technology and machine learning. My recent work has focused on combining high-resolution Earth observation data with predictive modeling to map soil and crop health at scale, delivering solutions that have secured €2M+ in enterprise contracts and mapped over 200,000 hectares worldwide.

## Open Source

I develop and maintain R packages for spatial and temporal analysis: [distantia](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=distantia) (dynamic time warping), [spatialRF](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=spatialRF) (spatial machine learning), [collinear](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=collinear) (multicollinearity management), [memoria](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=memoria) (ecological memory), and [virtualPollen](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=virtualPollen) (ecological simulation). Together, these packages have been downloaded over 100,000 times.


## Research Background

Before transitioning to industry, I built my expertise in world-class research labs across Spain, Denmark, and Norway. I've co-authored 49 peer-reviewed papers with 210 collaborators from 22 countries, with several recognized as "Most Downloaded" and "Editor's Pick" in their respective journals.

## Beyond Work

When I'm not working, I enjoy time with my family, tinkering on the piano, paddleboarding, and developing R packages.

## Let's Connect

I'm always open to discussing data science leadership, geospatial technology, and new opportunities. [Connect with me on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/blas-m-benito-6174a643/) or drop me an email.
